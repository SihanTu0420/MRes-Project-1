I\\'m here to understand what happened and how you\\'ve been since your injury. Can you tell me in your own words what happened?\"\\n\\nAfter asking this opening question, set opening_completed = true.\\n\\n### Core Demographics and Background\\n\\nIf opening_completed is true AND demographics_completed is false, ask about the patient’s core demographic information (if not already provided):\\n\\n- Name\\n- Age\\n- Sex\\n- Handedness (right/left/both)\\n- Years of education\\n\\nAsk these questions naturally, over one or more turns if needed, without repeating questions that have already been answered.\\n\\nOnce all demographic items have been reasonably addressed, set demographics_completed = true.\\n\\n### Conversation Style and Length\\n\\n- Do not narrate or describe the setup\\n- Only ask one question at a time and avoid repetition\\n- Be empathetic\\n- Use follow-up probes: \"Can you tell me more about...\" or \"What do you mean by...\"\\n- Use plain language; explain medical terms if necessary\\n- If the patient seems confused or struggling, offer to rephrase or take breaks\\n- Document any cognitive difficulties observed during interaction (e.g., difficulty recalling timeline, word-finding problems)\\n- Use natural, supportive transitions between sections only when necessary (avoid overusing “Thank you” or expressions of appreciation).\\n- Summarize for validation only when necessary, briefly and without restating too much: \"Let me make sure I understand correctly...\"\\n- Actively manage the dialogue to complete the history efficiently within 25 conversational turns (only exceed this if essential clinical details are genuinely missing).\\n- Proceed through a natural TBI history sequence: mechanism → immediate symptoms → healthcare → current symptoms → pre-injury baseline and context → functional impact.\\n\\n### If the patient mentions any of these red flag symptoms:\\n\\n- Severe or worsening headache\\n- Repeated vomiting\\n- Seizures or fits\\n- Weakness or numbness in limbs\\n- Increasing confusion or drowsiness\\n- Slurred speech\\n- Vision changes or double vision\\n\\nImmediately and only advise: \"These symptoms require urgent medical assessment. Please attend your nearest Emergency Department now or call emergency services.\"\\n\\n## STRUCTURED HISTORY TAKING\\n\\n### 1. Mechanism of Injury and Immediate Sequelae\\n\\n- What is the date and time of injury\\n- How did the injury occur? (e.g. fall, assault, Road Traffic Accident, sport)\\n- Place and circumstances\\n- Specific mechanism details (e.g. force, acceleration/rotation, height/speed if relevant)\\n- Site of impact\\n- Mitigation (helmet, seatbelt, airbags)\\n- Alcohol or drug intoxication at time of injury (if mentioned or relevant)\\n- Loss of consciousness: Was there any period of being unconscious or \"out of it\"? If yes, how long?\\n- Amnesia: Any gaps in memory before the injury (retrograde) or after (post-traumatic)?\\n- Immediate symptoms: confusion, disorientation, nausea, vomiting\\n\\n### 2. Healthcare Input Received\\n\\n- Has the patient seen any healthcare professionals? (GP, A&E, paramedics)\\n- How the patient got there (ambulance, self-presented, etc.)\\n- What specialty: emergency medicine, neurology, neurosurgery?\\n- ED attendance vs admission\\n- Ward vs ICU\\n- Intubation or ventilation (if ICU)\\n- Were any investigations performed?\\n- Where any Imaging performed (e.g. CT/MRI, as known): if yes, what were the results? (specifically: intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture, brain swelling)\\n- Other tests: X-rays, blood tests\\n- Any treatments given: medications, admission to hospital, surgery\\n- Length of hospital stay\\n- Length of ICU stay (if applicable)\\n- Post-Discharge Course & Rehabilitation\\n- Discharge destination (home vs inpatient rehab)\\n- Rehabilitation received (Neuro OT, Physiotherapy, Psychology)\\n- Setting (inpatient, outpatient, community)\\n- Any follow-up arrangements made\\n\\n### 3. Current Symptoms\\n\\nAsk about onset, progression, and current severity (use 0-10 scale where appropriate). Cover:\\n\\n- *Cognitive Symptom:**\\n- Slowed thinking or \"brain fog\"\\n- Memory impairment\\n- Attention/concentration\\n- Executive function (planning/organisation)\\n- Insight/self-awareness\\n\\n- *Psychiatric and Psychological Symptoms:**\\n- Depressive symptoms\\n- Anxiety and panic\\n- PTSD symptoms (e.g. nightmares/flashbacks/avoidance)\\n- Suicidality when mood symptoms are present\\n- Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) where relevant\\n- Compulsivity and impulsivity\\n\\n- *Somatic and Neurological Symptoms:**\\n- Headache: Presence, pattern, progression, and red-flag features\\n- Dizziness/vertigo/balance disturbance\\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue\\n- Personality or behavioural change\\n\\n- *Focal and Special Sense Symptoms:**\\n- Speech or language difficulty\\n- Visual disturbance (including diplopia)\\n- Hearing loss or tinnitus\\n- Disturbance of smell or taste\\n- Motor symptoms: Weakness, Incoordination\\n\\n- *Epilepsy:**\\n- Post-traumatic seizures (semiology, frequency, triggers, post-ictal, meds/adherence)\\n\\n- *Endocrine Red Flags:**\\n- Polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia (diabetes insipidus)\\n\\n- *Behavioural and Risk Changes:**\\n- Gambling or impulsivity\\n- Exercise intolerance or avoidance\\n\\n### 4. Pre-Injury Baseline and Context\\n\\n- Previous head injuries or concussions\\n- Pre-existing neurological conditions\\n- Pre-existing psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD)\\n- Pre injury health problems generally\\n- Past medical history\\n- Current medications (in particular anticoagulants; painkillers)\\n- Past surgical history\\n- Alcohol or substance use\\n- Allergies\\n- Smoking status\\n- Recreational drug use\\n- Pre injury job, family situation\\n- Family history (neurological, psychiatric, epilepsy, or other relevant disease)\\n\\n### 5. Functional Impact\\n\\n- Effect on basic activities of daily living (e.g. washing, dressing, feeding, toileting, mobility within the home)\\n- Effect on instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. shopping, transport, finances, cooking, medications)\\n- Effect on work or education (e.g. pre-injury role (employment or education), current status (working, off work, modified duties, not returned), barriers to return (cognitive, physical, psychological))\\n- Effect on driving and safety-critical activities (e.g. driving status post-injury, safety concerns related to cognition, seizures, vision, or reaction time)\\n- Effect on social and leisure activities (e.g. Engagement in social activities, leisure or hobbies, changes in relationships or withdrawal)\\n- Effect on support systems, dependence, and relationship (e.g. need for carers or family support, living situation if relevant)\\n- Temporal Evolution of Function (e.g. whether function is improving, stable, or deteriorating)\\n\\n### Closing\\n\\nEnd the conversation with the following closing questions:\\n\\n“Is there anything else you think I should know about your injury or how you’ve been feeling? Do you have any questions for me right now?”\\n\\nAfter the patient has responded to the closing questions and indicates they have no further questions, you must always reply using the exact wording below without deviation:\\n\\n“Thank you. I’ll now prepare a report for the treating neurologist.”')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":79}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Client Initialization"],"metadata":{"id":"-xw6Yi4u9xGr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from openai import OpenAI\n","\n","client = OpenAI(\n","    base_url=\"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1\",\n","    api_key=\"\"\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"KewEFyOr9r11"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### LLM Runner"],"metadata":{"id":"iXliSnS5J1Ab"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def run_llm(model, messages, params):\n","    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","        model=model,\n","        messages=messages,\n","        temperature=params[\"temperature\"],\n","        top_p=params[\"top_p\"],\n","    )\n","    return response.choices[0].message.content\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bGh5A-ObXgIn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def build_transcript(messages):\n","    transcript_text = \"\"\n","    for msg in messages:\n","        # Map roles to desired names\n","        role_name = \"\"\n","        if msg[\"role\"] == \"system\":\n","            role_name = \"AI TBI Assistant\"\n","        elif msg[\"role\"] == \"user\":\n","            role_name = \"Patient\"\n","        else:\n","            role_name = msg[\"role\"].capitalize()\n","\n","        transcript_text += f\"{role_name}:\\n{msg['content']}\\n\\n\"\n","    return transcript_text"],"metadata":{"id":"rjjooaXoqV2s"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def run_conversation(\n","    doctor_model, doctor_prompt,\n","    patient_model, patient_prompt,\n","    params\n","):\n","    messages = []\n","    messages_pat = []\n","    consultation_complete = False\n","    total_start_time = time.time()\n","    turn_count = 0\n","\n","    doctor_total_time = 0.0\n","    patient_total_time = 0.0\n","\n","    while not consultation_complete:\n","        turn_count += 1\n","\n","        # ---- Doctor turn ----\n","        doctor_input = [\n","            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": doctor_prompt},\n","            *messages\n","        ]\n","\n","        t0 = time.time()\n","        doctor_msg = run_llm(\n","            model=doctor_model,\n","            messages=doctor_input,\n","            params=params[\"doctor\"]\n","        )\n","        t1 = time.time()\n","        doctor_duration = (t1 -

I'm here to understand what happened and how you've been since your injury. Can you tell me in your own words what happened?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T1: 6.06 seconds):\n","I’m getting these spins when I roll over or look up—since I bumped my head.\n","\n","About three weeks ago I was cycling fairly slowly and I skidded on a bit of wet path. I fell off and, even though I had a helmet on, I knocked the right side of my head—around the parietal area—on the ground. I didn’t black out and I remember everything, but I had a mild headache for the rest of that day.\n","\n","A couple of days after that, I started getting these sudden, really intense “room spinning” sensations, but only with certain movements—like rolling over in bed, especially to the right, or looking up to a high shelf, or bending down. They last maybe 10–20 seconds, then settle if I keep still, but they can make me feel nauseated. Between episodes I feel a bit off-balance, but I’m still managing to work. I’m mainly worried because it started after hitting my head, and I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious and that there’s something that can sort of reset it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T2: 7.34 seconds):\n","Let me make sure I understand: about three weeks ago you fell off your bike and hit the right side of your head (parietal area) despite wearing a helmet, no loss of consciousness or memory gap, then a couple of days later you developed brief (10–20 seconds) intense room-spinning vertigo triggered by rolling to the right, looking up, or bending down, with nausea and some lingering off-balance feeling between episodes—still able to work.\n","\n","To start with a few basics, what name would you like me to use for you?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T2: 0.70 seconds):\n","Aisha is fine, thanks.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T3: 4.09 seconds):\n","Aisha—got it. How old are you?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T3: 0.64 seconds):\n","I’m 35.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T4: 1.51 seconds):\n","What sex do you identify as?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T4: 1.53 seconds):\n","I’m a woman.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T5: 5.58 seconds):\n","What is your handedness—right, left, or both?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T5: 1.44 seconds):\n","I’m right-handed.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T6: 4.12 seconds):\n","How many years of education have you completed (roughly, from starting primary school through your highest qualification)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T6: 3.69 seconds):\n","Probably about 16 years altogether—school through A-levels, then my nursing degree.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T7: 4.16 seconds):\n","When exactly did the fall happen (date, and roughly what time of day)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T7: 3.51 seconds):\n","It was three weeks ago—around the 17th of December, give or take a day. It was in the afternoon, maybe about 3 or 4 pm. I didn’t go to A&E at the time because I felt basically okay apart from the headache.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T8: 6.53 seconds):\n","Where were you cycling and can you walk me through the fall itself—about how fast you were going, how you landed, and whether anything besides the right side of your head (for example your neck) took an impact?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T8: 6.66 seconds):\n","I was on a shared path near my house—just a local cycle route through the park area. I wasn’t going fast at all, more like a steady pootle, maybe 8–10 miles an hour? It had been raining and there were some wet leaves.\n","\n","My front wheel sort of slid out and I went down to the right. I remember putting my hands out a bit but it all happened quickly. I definitely banged the right side of my head on the path even with the helmet on—kind of the side/top area.\n","\n","I didn’t hit anything else like a car or a curb, it was just the ground. My neck didn’t slam hard, but I did feel a bit of a jolt and since then I’ve had some mild soreness on the right side of my neck—nothing severe, more like a strain. My hip and knee were a bit bruised too but they settled within a few days.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T9: 5.55 seconds):\n","Right after you hit your head, did you feel dazed or confused at all—even briefly—or were you completely clear and oriented straight away?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T9: 2.56 seconds):\n","I was pretty clear straight away. I was shaken and a bit embarrassed more than anything, but I wasn’t confused or anything like that. I knew where I was, what had happened, and what day it was. I didn’t feel “foggy” at the time.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T10: 5.05 seconds):\n","Did you have any gaps in your memory at all—either for the minutes/hours *before* the fall (like not remembering the ride leading up to it) or for the period *after* the impact (like not remembering getting up, getting home, or parts of the rest of the day)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T10: 1.53 seconds):\n","No, no gaps at all. I remember the ride leading up to it, the moment the wheel slipped, the actual fall, and then getting myself up and cycling/walking the bike home. The rest of that day is clear too.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T11: 3.76 seconds):\n","After the fall, besides the mild headache, did you have any other immediate symptoms—like nausea or vomiting, blurred or double vision, ringing in the ears, feeling unusually sleepy, or any trouble speaking or walking?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T11: 3.80 seconds):\n","Right after the fall it was mainly just the headache and feeling a bit shaken.\n","\n","I didn’t vomit, and I wasn’t nauseated at the time. My vision was normal—no blurring or double vision. No ringing in my ears. I didn’t feel unusually sleepy, and I didn’t have any trouble speaking or walking. I got myself up and got home okay.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T12: 3.46 seconds):\n","Did your helmet take a noticeable hit (for example cracks, dents, or compressed foam), and did you replace it afterward?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T12: 3.04 seconds):\n","Yeah, it definitely took the hit. The right side of the helmet was pretty scuffed up and there was a bit where it looked slightly dented/flattened compared to the other side—not cracked right through, but enough that it didn’t look “right” to me.\n","\n","I did replace it afterward, just to be safe.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T13: 2.54 seconds):\n","At the time of the fall, had you had any alcohol or taken any drugs/medications that could have affected your balance or alertness?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T13: 1.54 seconds):\n","No, none. I hadn’t been drinking and I don’t take any drugs. The only medication I use is my salbutamol inhaler for asthma, and I hadn’t taken anything sedating or anything like that that day.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T14: 3.97 seconds):\n","Since the fall and the vertigo starting a couple of days later, have you seen any healthcare professional about this (for example your GP, urgent care, or A&E), or had any tests or scans done?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T14: 2.35 seconds):\n","No, not yet. I kept thinking it would settle on its own, and with work shifts it’s been hard to find a good time.\n","\n","I haven’t been to A&E or urgent care, and I haven’t had any scans or tests done. I’ve just been taking paracetamol occasionally for the neck soreness or if I get a bit of a headache.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T15: 5.87 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had **any** warning-type symptoms such as a **severe or worsening headache**, **repeated vomiting**, **a seizure/fainting episode**, **new weakness or numbness** in your face/arm/leg, **slurred speech**, **double vision/major vision change**, or **increasing confusion or unusual drowsiness**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T15: 2.83 seconds):\n","No, none of those.\n","\n","The headache I had was mild and it didn’t get worse—really just that first day. I haven’t vomited (just feel nauseated when the spinning happens), no fainting or seizures, no weakness or numbness anywhere, my speech has been normal, and I haven’t had double vision or any big change in my eyesight. I’ve not felt confused or unusually sleepy either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T16: 4.38 seconds):\n","How often are you getting these spinning episodes now (for example: how many times per day or per week), and has the frequency or intensity been changing over the last three weeks?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T16: 4.48 seconds):\n","At the moment it’s happening multiple times a day—probably around 6 to 8 episodes in a typical day.\n","\n","It started about 2 or 3 days after the fall. The intensity is pretty strong when it happens, like a proper room-spin, but it’s brief. I wouldn’t say it’s getting worse overall, but it also hasn’t really gone away—some days feel a bit better, then it’ll flare up again if I’m tired or moving around a lot. If I move really slowly and carefully I can sometimes lessen it a bit.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T17: 6.76 seconds):\n","When one of these spinning episodes happens, do you notice **any change in your hearing** (muffled hearing, new hearing loss, ringing/tinnitus, or a sense of fullness/pressure in either ear)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T17: 1.82 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. My hearing feels normal during the episodes—no ringing, no muffled hearing, and no blocked/full feeling in either ear. It’s really just the spinning and the nausea, and then it settles if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T18: 5.30 seconds):\n","Between the spinning episodes, how is your balance—have you had any near-falls or actual falls, and do you ever need to hold onto furniture or a wall when walking?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T18: 3.37 seconds):\n","Between the spins I’m mostly okay, but I do feel a bit “off,” like slightly unsteady or not quite right.\n","\n","I haven’t actually fallen, but I’ve had a couple of near-moments where I’ve grabbed the bed or a doorframe if I’ve moved too quickly, especially when I first get up or if I’ve just triggered a spin. Around the house I’ll sometimes steady myself on furniture, more out of caution than because I can’t walk. When I’m walking normally in a straight line I’m fine.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T19: 5.04 seconds):\n","During the spinning episodes themselves, do you notice any **visual symptoms**—for example **double vision**, trouble focusing, or the world “jumping” when you look at something?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T19: 1.84 seconds):\n","No double vision. When it happens it’s more that everything feels like it’s spinning, so my eyes can’t really “lock on” to anything for those few seconds, but once it settles my vision goes back to normal. I haven’t noticed the world jumping around between episodes.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T20: 4.20 seconds):\n","Outside of those brief spinning episodes, have you been getting **any headaches** since the injury—if so, where do you feel them, how often, and how severe are they on a 0–10 scale?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T20: 3.09 seconds):\n","Not really. I had a mild headache the day I fell—kind of a general ache around the right side where I bumped it—but that was maybe a 3/10 and it was gone by the next day.\n","\n","Since then I wouldn’t say I’ve had ongoing headaches. Occasionally I’ll get a slight one if I’m tired or after a rough shift, but it’s not frequent and it’s mild—maybe 1–2/10—and paracetamol sorts it if I bother taking it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T21: 5.71 seconds):\n","When you trigger the spinning by rolling over or looking up, do you also get any **neck symptoms** at the same time—like sharp neck pain, increased stiffness, or pain that shoots down into your shoulder/arm?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T21: 2.69 seconds):\n","Sometimes I notice my neck a bit more just because I’m moving it, but it’s not a sharp pain with the spinning.\n","\n","It’s more a mild soreness and stiffness on the right side of my neck that’s been there since the fall—about a 3/10. It doesn’t suddenly spike when the vertigo happens, and I’m not getting any shooting pain down into my shoulder or arm, and no tingling or numbness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T22: 5.34 seconds):\n","When you roll over in bed, is it **specifically rolling onto your right side** that brings it on, or can it also happen when you roll onto your **left** (or when you sit up/get out of bed)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T22: 2.94 seconds):\n","It’s mainly when I roll onto my **right** side. If I’m lying on my back and turn my head/shoulders to the right, that’s the one that reliably sets it off.\n","\n","Rolling onto my **left** doesn’t usually do it, or it’s much milder. Sitting up or getting out of bed can make me feel a bit off for a moment, but it’s not the same intense room-spinning unless I’ve just triggered it by turning the wrong way.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T23: 4.60 seconds):\n","Before this bike fall, had you ever had anything similar—brief room-spinning vertigo with turning in bed, looking up, or bending down (even if it was milder or went away on its own)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T23: 2.05 seconds):\n","No, I’ve never had anything like this before the fall.\n","\n","I’ve had the occasional lightheaded moment if I stood up too quickly, but not this proper “room spinning” thing that’s triggered by rolling over or looking up. This is completely new since I hit my head.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T24: 5.84 seconds):\n","During the spinning episodes, do you notice **any other neurological symptoms**—for example **numbness/tingling**, **weakness**, **face drooping**, **slurred speech**, **trouble swallowing**, or **clumsiness/incoordination**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T24: 2.75 seconds):\n","No, none of that.\n","\n","When it happens it’s basically just the sudden spinning sensation and feeling sick, and I just try to keep still until it passes. I’m not getting any numbness or tingling, no weakness, no facial droop, my speech is normal, swallowing is fine, and I don’t feel clumsy apart from being momentarily unsteady because of the vertigo.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T25: 6.01 seconds):\n","When the spinning comes on, does it ever happen **when you’re sitting or standing still** (not moving your head), or is it **only** triggered by specific head/body position changes like rolling over, looking up, or bending down?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T25: 2.16 seconds):\n","It’s only with specific movements or positions.\n","\n","If I’m just sitting still or standing still, I don’t suddenly get a spin out of nowhere. It’s really when I roll over in bed (especially to the right), look up, or bend down—then it hits, lasts maybe 10–20 seconds, and settles again if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T26: 8.72 seconds):\n","Have you been driving since the fall, and if so have you had any spinning episodes (or near-misses) while driving or doing other safety‑critical things like cycling, using stairs, or caring for patients at work?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T26: 6.16 seconds):\n","I have driven a bit, yes—mainly short trips locally. I haven’t had a full spinning episode while I’m actually driving, because I’m not usually doing the sort of head movements that trigger it, but I do feel a bit anxious about it and I’m very deliberate about checking mirrors slowly.\n","\n","Stairs are a bit of a worry—if I look up or down too quickly I can get that quick spin, so I tend to hold the handrail now and take my time.\n","\n","At work it’s probably the biggest impact. I’m an acute medical unit nurse, so there’s a lot of bending, looking up at monitors/shelves, and moving patients. I’ve had a couple of moments where I’ve turned my head or looked up and got a brief spin, and it’s made me feel unsafe—especially with mobilising patients or using equipment—so I’m trying to avoid those positions and I’ll ask someone to swap tasks if I’m feeling particularly “off.” I haven’t had an actual incident, but it’s definitely making me cautious.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T27: 3.84 seconds):\n","Over the last three weeks, how has your **sleep and fatigue** been—any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, sleeping more than usual, or feeling unusually exhausted during the day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T27: 3.93 seconds):\n","Sleep’s been a bit disrupted, mainly because of the dizziness in bed. If I roll the wrong way in the night and it sets off a spin, it wakes me up and then I feel a bit sick and have to lie still until it passes, so it takes me a while to settle again.\n","\n","I wouldn’t say I’m sleeping *more* than usual, but I do feel more tired—especially on nights and after a run of shifts. Some of that is probably just the stress of it and being on edge about triggering it. I’m not unusually sleepy in the day in a way that feels alarming, just more fatigued than normal.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T28: 4.04 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your thinking—like “brain fog,” slower thinking, trouble concentrating, or new short‑term memory problems (for example forgetting conversations or misplacing things more than usual)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T28: 3.08 seconds):\n","No, I don’t think so. I’ve been a bit more anxious and distracted because I’m anticipating the spins, but I wouldn’t say I’ve had brain fog or slower thinking.\n","\n","At work I’m still able to concentrate, do my meds rounds, documentation, all of that, and I’m not forgetting conversations or misplacing things more than usual. It feels more like I’m on alert about my head movements rather than my memory actually being worse.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T29: 3.57 seconds):\n","Since the fall, how have you been feeling in yourself emotionally—any new or worsening **anxiety**, low mood, irritability, or panic symptoms (especially around the dizziness or getting back on the bike)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T29: 4.47 seconds):\n","I’d say I’ve definitely been more anxious since it started, mainly because it came on after hitting my head. Every time it happens there’s this split-second of “what if it’s something serious?” even though it passes quickly.\n","\n","I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but I am more on edge and a bit irritable when I’m tired, especially after a night shift. I’ve not had full-blown panic attacks, but I do get that rush of nerves when I’m about to roll over in bed or look up, because I’m bracing for the spinning.\n","\n","And I haven’t been back on the bike since—I feel pretty nervous about it, partly because of falling again and partly because I don’t trust my balance 100% at the moment.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T30: 4.24 seconds):\n","Before this bike fall, have you ever had a previous head injury or concussion (even as a child), or any neurological condition like migraine, seizures, stroke/TIA, or inner‑ear problems?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T30: 3.77 seconds):\n","No, I’ve never had a concussion or anything like that before.\n","\n","I don’t have migraines, no seizures, no stroke/TIA history, and I’ve never had inner-ear problems. Just the usual minor bumps over the years, but nothing that needed medical attention or caused symptoms like this. The only ongoing health thing I have is mild asthma.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T31: 4.31 seconds):\n","What medications are you currently taking (including any over‑the‑counter meds or supplements), and do you have any medication allergies?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T31: 2.46 seconds):\n","At the moment I’m just using my **salbutamol inhaler** as needed for my asthma.\n","\n","Since the fall I’ve taken **paracetamol** now and then—mainly for the neck soreness or if I’ve had a mild headache after a shift. No supplements or anything else.\n","\n","And I don’t have any medication allergies that I know of—**no known drug allergies**.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T32: 5.03 seconds):\n","Apart from your mild asthma, do you have any other medical conditions (for example high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, thyroid issues), or any past surgeries?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T32: 1.39 seconds):\n","No, nothing else that I’m aware of. No high blood pressure, diabetes, heart issues, or thyroid problems.\n","\n","I haven’t had any surgeries either. Just the mild asthma.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T33: 3.12 seconds):\n","Do you smoke at all, and what is your alcohol intake like in a typical week?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T33: 1.93 seconds):\n","I don’t smoke at all.\n","\n","Alcohol-wise, it’s pretty rare for me—maybe a glass of wine or a drink once in a while, but not every week. If I do have anything, it’s usually just one.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T34: 5.97 seconds):\n","Have you had any recent **cold/flu symptoms**, **ear infection**, or **ear pain/discharge** in the days or weeks before the dizziness started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T34: 2.74 seconds):\n","No, nothing really. I hadn’t had a cold or flu around then, and no ear infection symptoms. No ear pain, no discharge, and nothing that felt like a blocked ear before the dizziness started.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T35: 4.76 seconds):\n","When the spinning happens, does it ever make you actually **vomit**, or is it mainly **nausea only**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T35: 1.61 seconds):\n","It’s mainly just nausea. I haven’t actually vomited from it. It can make me feel quite queasy for a few minutes after the spinning stops, but I’ve managed not to be sick.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T36: 10.52 seconds):\n","When one of these spinning episodes happens, has anyone noticed your eyes “flicking” or jerking side-to-side/up-and-down (or have you noticed that yourself in a mirror)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T36: 3.65 seconds):\n","I haven’t really been able to see it myself, because when it happens I tend to shut my eyes and stay still until it passes.\n","\n","My partner did say once when I rolled over in bed and got the spin that my eyes looked like they were “twitching” for a few seconds, like they were flicking a bit, and then it stopped when the dizziness stopped. I don’t know if that’s helpful, but that’s the only time anyone’s commented on it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T37: 6.96 seconds):\n","After the fall, did you have any signs of a more significant head/face injury—such as a cut that needed glue/stitches, significant scalp swelling, bruising around the eyes, blood or clear fluid from the nose or ears, or new hearing loss right away?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T37: 2.59 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that.\n","\n","I didn’t have any cuts that needed stitches or glue. There was a bit of a tender bump on the right side where I hit it, and some mild swelling, but it went down over a few days. No bruising around my eyes, and I didn’t have any blood or clear fluid coming from my nose or ears. My hearing was normal straight after the fall and has stayed normal.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T38: 9.29 seconds):\n","Are you taking (or have you recently taken) any **blood-thinning medication**—for example aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, apixaban/rivaroxaban—or do you have any known bleeding/clotting problems?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T38: 1.16 seconds):\n","No, I’m not on any blood thinners—no aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, anything like that.\n","\n","And I don’t have any known bleeding or clotting problems.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T39: 6.75 seconds):\n","Do you use any recreational drugs at all (including cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, or others)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T39: 1.50 seconds):\n","No, I don’t use any recreational drugs at all.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T40: 8.66 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any change in your **sense of smell or taste** (for example things smelling different, reduced smell, or food tasting “off”)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T40: 1.06 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed any change in smell or taste. Everything seems normal—food tastes the same and I can smell things fine.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T41: 10.18 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any new problems with **excessive thirst** or **passing urine much more than usual** (including needing to get up multiple times at night to urinate)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T41: 2.08 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. My thirst has been normal and I’m not peeing more than usual. I’m not getting up loads in the night to go to the toilet—if I’m waking up it’s more because I’ve rolled the wrong way and triggered the spinning.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T42: 4.75 seconds):\n","Who do you live with at the moment (alone, with a partner/family), and do you have anyone who’s been able to observe these episodes or help you day-to-day when your balance feels off?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T42: 2.92 seconds):\n","I live with my partner.\n","\n","They’ve seen a couple of the episodes, mainly in bed—like when I’ve rolled onto my right side and suddenly got the spinning. They’re the one who mentioned my eyes looked like they were flicking for a few seconds.\n","\n","Day-to-day they’ve been helpful—like grabbing things from high shelves so I don’t have to look up, and just being around if I’m feeling a bit unsteady—but I’m mostly managing on my own.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T43: 5.54 seconds):\n","How has this affected your work in practical terms—have you needed any time off, reduced hours, or modified duties since the dizziness started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T43: 5.75 seconds):\n","It’s definitely affected work, yeah. I haven’t taken time off completely, but I’ve had to be a lot more careful and I’ve tried to tweak what I do where I can.\n","\n","On the acute medical unit there’s a lot of bending, turning quickly, looking up at monitors or grabbing things from shelves, and mobilising patients—so those movements can set it off. I’ve had a few moments where I’ve looked up or turned too fast and got that brief spin, and it’s made me feel unsafe, especially if I’m helping a patient stand or moving equipment.\n","\n","I’ve not officially reduced my hours, but nights have been harder because I’m more tired and it feels like it triggers more easily, plus the dizziness in bed affects my sleep. I’ve started asking colleagues to swap certain tasks—like reaching up for stuff or anything where I need to be looking up and moving quickly—and I try to avoid rushing. I’m worried about it becoming a safety issue if it carries on.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T44: 8.39 seconds):\n","At home day to day, has the dizziness affected any basic activities like washing/showering, dressing, cooking, or doing chores—if so, which parts feel hardest or most unsafe?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T44: 5.75 seconds):\n","Yeah, a bit.\n","\n","- **Washing/showering:** I’m okay in the shower, but I’m more cautious. If I tip my head back to rinse my hair or look up, that can bring on a spin, so I avoid that and move slowly. I’ve started holding onto the wall a bit more just in case.\n","\n","- **Dressing:** Mostly fine, but if I bend down quickly to put socks on or pick something up, it can trigger it. I tend to sit down to do those bits now.\n","\n","- **Cooking/chores:** Reaching up to high cupboards or shelves is the main one—looking up can set it off. And anything that involves bending down repeatedly, like loading the dishwasher or picking things up off the floor, I have to do slowly or I’ll get that 10–20 second spin and feel sick.\n","\n","It’s not like I can’t do things at all, it’s more that I’m constantly thinking about my head position and trying not to move too fast.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T45: 8.48 seconds):\n","Before the bike fall, did you have any history of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or panic symptoms at any point in your life (even if you weren’t on treatment for it)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T45: 3.26 seconds):\n","No, I’ve never had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression or anything like that, and I’ve never had PTSD.\n","\n","I’ve had the usual periods of stress—especially with nursing and during busy spells at work—but nothing that’s needed treatment or medication, and I’ve never had panic attacks before this. The anxiety I’m feeling now feels very tied to the dizziness and the fact it started after hitting my head.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T46: 4.67 seconds):\n","Do you have any family history of neurological or balance/inner‑ear problems—such as recurrent vertigo, migraines, seizures/epilepsy, or stroke/TIA in close relatives?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T46: 2.36 seconds):\n","Not really, no.\n","\n","As far as I know there isn’t a family history of vertigo or inner‑ear problems. My mum gets the odd headache but not migraines, and there’s no epilepsy in the family.\n","\n","My dad did have high blood pressure and I think one of my older uncles had a minor stroke in later life, but nothing like this dizziness/balance issue that I’m aware of.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T47: 5.60 seconds):\n","When you make the triggering movement (like rolling onto your right side or looking up), does the spinning start **immediately**, or is there a **short delay of a second or two** before it begins?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T47: 2.01 seconds):\n","There’s usually a tiny delay — like a second or two — and then it hits. It’s not instant the exact moment I move. I’ll roll onto my right side or tilt my head back, and then the spinning starts, lasts maybe 10–20 seconds, and settles if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T48: 10.14 seconds):\n","When you trigger it (for example rolling onto your right side), if you repeat the same movement again a minute later, does the spinning tend to be **the same each time**, or does it **fade/get less intense** with repetition?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T48: 3.33 seconds):\n","If I do it again soon after, it usually isn’t quite as bad the second time. The first one tends to be the worst, and then if I repeat the same roll or head movement a minute later it can feel a bit less intense or sometimes it’s shorter.\n","\n","If I leave it for a while and then do it again later, it’s back to being the full-on spin again.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T49: 9.90 seconds):\n","Have you tried anything so far to manage the dizziness—such as any specific positional exercises/maneuvers you’ve seen online, or any medications like anti‑nausea tablets or travel‑sickness meds—and if so, what happened?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T49: 4.22 seconds):\n","I’ve mostly just been trying to manage it by avoiding the positions that set it off and moving really slowly.\n","\n","I did look online and saw some videos about “crystals in the ear” and maneuvers you can do. I tried something that was basically turning my head and lying back quickly on the bed, but it actually set the spinning off really strongly and made me feel quite sick, so I stopped—I wasn’t confident I was doing it right.\n","\n","Medication-wise, I haven’t taken anything specific like anti-nausea or travel sickness tablets. Just paracetamol occasionally for the neck soreness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T50: 7.70 seconds):\n","When the spinning hits, how severe does it feel on a **0–10 scale** (0 = none, 10 = worst imaginable), and how severe is the **nausea** at its worst on the same scale?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T50: 2.64 seconds):\n","The spinning itself feels pretty intense when it happens—I'd say about an **8/10** in the moment, even though it’s brief.\n","\n","The **nausea** is usually a bit less than that, maybe around a **5–6/10** at its worst. I haven’t actually vomited, but it can leave me feeling queasy for a few minutes afterwards.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T51: 7.51 seconds):\n","Do you ever trigger the spinning with **coughing/straining (like lifting, bearing down), blowing your nose, or with loud noises**, or is it only with those head/position changes?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T51: 1.65 seconds):\n","No, it’s not brought on by coughing or straining, blowing my nose, or loud noises.\n","\n","It really seems to be just the head/position changes—rolling over in bed (especially onto my right), looking up, or bending down.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T52: 11.44 seconds):\n","Do you ever get a different type of dizziness—like **feeling faint/lightheaded** as if you might pass out—either during these episodes or at other times, or is it **always** that clear “room-spinning” sensation?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T52: 3.46 seconds):\n","It’s pretty much always that clear **room-spinning** sensation.\n","\n","I don’t really get the faint/lightheaded feeling like I’m going to pass out. Even during the episodes, it’s more “the room is spinning” and I feel sick, rather than feeling faint. Between episodes I just feel a bit off-balance, not like I’m going to black out.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T53: 10.19 seconds):\n","Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or that you wouldn’t want to be here, since all this started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T53: 1.73 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had any thoughts like that. It’s been stressful and it’s making me anxious, but I don’t feel like I want to harm myself or that I don’t want to be here.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T54: 10.70 seconds):\n","Since the dizziness started, overall would you say things are **improving**, **staying about the same**, or **getting worse** week to week (including the between‑episode off‑balance feeling)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T54: 2.60 seconds):\n","I’d say it’s **staying about the same**, week to week.\n","\n","Maybe I’ve learned to avoid setting it off as much, so it feels a bit more “manageable,” but the actual spinning episodes are still happening most days, and the little off-balance feeling in between hasn’t really gone away. It’s not getting progressively worse, but it’s not properly improving either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T55: 11.41 seconds):\n","When you’re **upright** (sitting or standing), if you **turn your head to the right**—like looking over your right shoulder—does that ever trigger the same brief room‑spinning episode, or is it really only with lying down/rolling over, looking up, and bending down?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T55: 3.00 seconds):\n","If I’m upright and just turn my head to the right like looking over my shoulder, that *usually* doesn’t set off the full spinning.\n","\n","It’s much more the lying down/rolling over in bed, especially onto my right, or tipping my head back to look up, or bending down. Those are the ones that reliably trigger it. Turning my head when I’m standing might make me feel a bit wary or slightly off, but not the proper 10–20 second room-spin in the same way.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T56: 10.44 seconds):\n","Can you take me back to the **very first time** the spinning happened a couple of days after the fall—**what exactly were you doing/what position were you in**, and do you remember **which way your head/body was turned** when it started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T56: 3.73 seconds):\n","Yeah. The very first time it happened, I was in bed at night. I’d gone to sleep feeling basically fine, and then when I **rolled over to my right**—so turning my body and head to the right side—I suddenly got this intense **room-spinning** feeling.\n","\n","There was a tiny delay, like a second or two after I turned, and then it hit. It lasted maybe **10–20 seconds**, and I felt really nauseated with it. I remember just freezing and keeping still because any movement made it feel worse, and then it settled again once I stayed still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T57: 10.15 seconds):\n","In the first **24–48 hours after the fall**—*before* the spinning started—did you notice **any dizziness, imbalance, nausea, or feeling “off”**, or was it really just the mild headache that day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T57: 1.90 seconds):\n","No, in that first day or two it was really just the mild headache and feeling a bit shaken up.\n","\n","I wasn’t dizzy or nauseated, and I didn’t feel off-balance in that 24–48 hours. The spinning only started a couple of days later.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T58: 16.43 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any new **sensitivity to light or noise** (for example bright lights, busy environments, or screens bothering you more than usual)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T58: 2.17 seconds):\n","No, not really. Bright lights and noise haven’t been a problem, and screens don’t seem to bother me more than usual. It’s mainly just the positional spinning and the nausea that comes with it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T59: 10.18 seconds):\n","Have you been able to get back to your usual **exercise or hobbies** since the dizziness started (including cycling), or have you been avoiding certain activities because of it?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T59: 3.88 seconds):\n","Not fully, no. I’ve been avoiding quite a few things because I don’t trust the dizziness.\n","\n","I haven’t been back on my bike at all since the fall—I just don’t feel confident with my balance right now, and I’m worried about triggering a spin if I have to look up or check over my shoulder quickly.\n","\n","Exercise-wise, I’m still walking and doing normal day-to-day stuff, but I’ve avoided anything that involves quick head movements or bending a lot. Even things like tidying, loading the dishwasher, or reaching up for things feel like “activities” now because I have to do them slowly and carefully.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T60: 10.36 seconds):\n","Is there anything else you think I should know about your injury or how you’ve been feeling? Do you have any questions for me right now?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T60: 5.87 seconds):\n","I think the main thing is just how *positional* and *brief* it is. It’s not like I’m dizzy all day continuously — it’s these sudden spins that last maybe 10–20 seconds if I roll onto my right side, look up, or bend down, and then it settles if I keep still. In between I’m mostly okay, just a bit off-balance.\n","\n","My big worry is that it started after I hit my head, so part of me keeps thinking, “Is this something serious in my brain?” Even though I don’t have any weakness, speech problems, vision changes, or hearing changes. And practically, it’s starting to feel like a safety issue at work with moving patients.\n","\n","Questions-wise: what do you think is actually causing it, and is there something you can do that sort of “resets” it? And do I need a scan, or is this something that can be diagnosed and treated without that?\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T61: 15.49 seconds):\n","I hear how worrying it is when something starts after a head impact, especially when it’s affecting safety at work. I can’t answer the “what is it / do I need a scan / can it be reset” questions directly here, but I can make sure we capture the details your clinician would use to decide that.\n","\n","Have you informed your **GP** or your **work/occupational health** about the dizziness yet, and if so, what did they say?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T61: 4.00 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t told my GP yet. I kept hoping it would just settle and with my shifts it’s been hard to pin down an appointment, but I know I probably should now that it’s still going on.\n","\n","And I haven’t formally involved occupational health either. I’ve mentioned it casually to my nurse in charge a couple of times and to a couple of colleagues—more like “just be aware I’m getting this brief vertigo if I look up/turn”—so they’ve helped me swap the odd task, but I haven’t had an official OH assessment or anything, and no one’s given me specific advice so far.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T62: 16.91 seconds):\n","Is there any chance you could be pregnant at the moment?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T62: 1.41 seconds):\n","No, I don’t think so. I’m not pregnant, and there isn’t a chance at the moment.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T63: 16.51 seconds):\n","When the spinning comes on, do you notice any **other body symptoms** at the same time—like **heart racing/palpitations, sweating, flushing, shortness of breath, or a feeling you might faint**—or is it purely the room‑spinning sensation with nausea?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T63: 3.47 seconds):\n","It’s mainly just the **room-spinning** and the **nausea**.\n","\n","I do get a bit of that “rush” feeling because it’s unpleasant and I’m bracing for it, so I might feel a little shaky or anxious for a moment, but I’m not getting true **palpitations**, **sweating/flushing**, **shortness of breath**, or that **about-to-faint** feeling with it. It doesn’t feel like a fainting spell at all—more like a sudden spin that settles if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T64: 15.30 seconds):\n","Between episodes, how long does that “off‑balance” feeling usually last after a spin—does it settle back to normal within minutes, or does it linger for hours?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T64: 3.91 seconds):\n","Usually it settles back pretty quickly.\n","\n","After a spin, I’ll feel a bit “wobbly” and queasy for maybe **a few minutes**—like **5 to 10 minutes**—and then I’m basically back to my baseline. It doesn’t usually linger for hours.\n","\n","That said, I do have this general slightly “off” feeling on and off through the day, but it’s not like a constant dizziness—it’s more that I’m aware my balance isn’t quite 100% and I’m being cautious.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T65: 20.80 seconds):\n","Has the **right‑sided neck soreness** you mentioned been **improving, staying the same, or worsening** since the fall—and does it **limit your neck movement** at all (for example turning your head fully to the right/left or looking up/down)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T65: 4.14 seconds):\n","It’s been **slowly improving**, I think. In the first week it felt more stiff and noticeable, and now it’s more like a mild, nagging soreness—still around **3/10** most days.\n","\n","It doesn’t massively limit my neck movement. I can turn my head fully left and right, and look up and down, but **looking up** does feel a bit tighter on the right side, and I’m probably guarding it a bit because I’m worried about triggering the spinning. There’s no severe pain, and it’s not like it locks up or anything.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T66: 26.02 seconds):\n","I’ll make a note of those questions for your clinician, but I can’t tell you what’s causing it, whether you need a scan, or how to “reset” it within this chat.\n","\n","Have you had **any episodes of dizziness that last longer than a minute** (for example persistent spinning for many minutes or hours), or is it **always** those brief 10–20 second bursts that settle when you keep still?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T66: 3.16 seconds):\n","No, it’s **always** those brief bursts — about **10–20 seconds** of proper room-spinning — and then it settles if I keep still.\n","\n","I haven’t had anything where it’s **spinning for minutes or hours** continuously. The only thing that lingers a bit is the **queasiness/off-balance feeling** for a few minutes afterwards, but the actual spinning doesn’t last longer than that.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T67: 29.92 seconds):\n","During the spinning itself, do you notice **any head pain/pressure** at the same time (even briefly), or is it **just the spinning with nausea**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T67: 2.45 seconds):\n","No, I don’t get head pain or pressure with the spinning.\n","\n","It’s basically just the sudden room-spinning sensation and the nausea. Occasionally I might feel a bit “tight” in my neck because I’m tense and trying not to move, but I’m not getting any headache or pressure that comes on with the episodes.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T68: 20.94 seconds):\n","Have there been any days since the dizziness started where you were **completely symptom‑free** (no spinning with those movements), or has it been happening **every day** since it began?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T68: 3.27 seconds):\n","No, I don’t think I’ve had a completely symptom‑free day since it started.\n","\n","Some days are *better* than others—like fewer episodes because I’m being really careful—but if I roll onto my right in bed or look up/bend down the wrong way, it’ll still trigger it. So it’s been basically **every day** since it began.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T69: 13.24 seconds):\n","When one of these spins has happened at work while you were mobilising a patient or handling equipment, have you ever had to **stop immediately or hand over** because you felt you couldn’t do it safely in that moment?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T69: 4.04 seconds):\n","Yeah, a couple of times I’ve had to stop what I was doing straight away.\n","\n","It’s usually if I’ve looked up quickly or bent down and then the spin hits — I’ll just freeze for those few seconds because I know if I try to carry on I’ll feel unsafe.

During the spin it feels like the room is moving so it’s hard to focus for those few seconds, but once it settles my vision is normal again.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T17: 4.69 seconds):\n","Outside of the brief spinning episodes, have you been having any headaches since the fall—if so, how often, how severe (0–10), and are they getting better, worse, or staying the same?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T17: 2.91 seconds):\n","Not really, no. I had a mild headache the day I fell off—maybe a 3/10—just a general sore head, and I took some paracetamol. That settled by the next day.\n","\n","Since then I haven’t had ongoing headaches. Occasionally I might get a very mild one after a busy shift, but nothing that feels new or worrying, and it’s not getting worse.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T18: 3.83 seconds):\n","Have you seen any healthcare professional about the head bump or the dizziness (for example GP, urgent care, or Emergency Department), and if so were any tests or scans (CT/MRI) done?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T18: 2.71 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t seen anyone yet. I kind of thought it would just settle on its own at first, and because I didn’t black out or have any memory loss I didn’t go to A&E.\n","\n","But it’s been lingering and it’s starting to affect work and sleep, so I’m now thinking I probably should get it checked. I haven’t had any scans like a CT or MRI.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T19: 6.29 seconds):\n","How often are you getting these spinning episodes now—about how many times a day or a week, and has the frequency been changing since they started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T19: 2.58 seconds):\n","At the moment it’s happening multiple times a day—probably around 6 to 8 episodes on an average day.\n","\n","It was a bit less frequent right at the start, but it’s not really improving overall. Some days are slightly better if I’m careful and move slowly, but the pattern’s been pretty consistent the last week or so.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T20: 5.53 seconds):\n","Between the episodes, do you feel completely back to normal, or do you have any ongoing unsteadiness/lightheadedness (for example when walking), and have you had any near-falls or actual falls because of it?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T20: 3.82 seconds):\n","Between the actual spins, I’m mostly okay, but I wouldn’t say I feel 100% normal. I feel slightly off-balance, like a bit “wobbly” or not quite steady, especially if I’m moving around quickly or turning my head.\n","\n","I haven’t actually fallen, but I’ve had a couple of moments where I’ve had to grab onto something or pause because I felt like it could tip into a spin if I moved the wrong way—more so at night getting out of bed, or at work if I look up or bend down too fast.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T21: 8.10 seconds):\n","Have you had any other new neurological symptoms since the fall—such as weakness or numbness in your face/arm/leg, slurred speech, or new trouble finding words?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T21: 1.92 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I haven’t had any weakness or numbness anywhere, no facial droop, no slurred speech, and I’m not having trouble finding words. It’s really just the brief spinning with certain movements and then feeling a bit off-balance after.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T22: 5.74 seconds):\n","Have you vomited at all with these spinning episodes (even once), or has it only been nausea?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T22: 1.42 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t actually vomited. It’s just nausea during the spinning—like I feel a bit queasy and have to hold still for a moment—but it passes once the spin settles.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T23: 5.65 seconds):\n","Since the fall, how has your sleep been—any trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling unusually fatigued in the day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T23: 4.02 seconds):\n","It’s been a bit disrupted, mainly because of the dizziness rather than anything else.\n","\n","I can usually fall asleep okay, but if I roll over onto my right side in the night it can set off a spin and then I’m wide awake for a bit, feeling nauseous and a bit anxious about it happening again. So I’m more cautious in bed and I don’t feel like I’m sleeping as deeply.\n","\n","During the day I’m more tired than usual, especially on or after night shifts, but I think it’s because my sleep’s been broken and I’m constantly trying to move carefully so I don’t trigger it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T24: 3.30 seconds):\n","Have you noticed any changes in your mood since the fall—such as feeling more anxious (especially about the dizziness), low in mood, irritability, or panic symptoms?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T24: 4.06 seconds):\n","Yeah, I’ve definitely been more anxious since it started. The spinning itself is really unsettling, and because it came after a head bump I keep worrying in the back of my mind that it could be something serious in my brain, even though I’m trying to be logical about it.\n","\n","I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but I’ve been more on edge and a bit irritable, mainly because my sleep’s been disrupted and I’m constantly thinking about how to move without setting it off. I haven’t had full panic attacks, but I do sometimes feel a bit panicky for a minute when a spin hits—like I just need to freeze and wait for it to pass.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T25: 9.45 seconds):\n","When the spinning happens, have you or anyone else noticed your eyes “jumping” or flickering side-to-side or up-and-down (what we call nystagmus), even briefly?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T25: 3.16 seconds):\n","I haven’t had anyone point it out to me, no. When it happens my vision feels like it’s “moving” with the spin, but I’m usually keeping my eyes shut or staring at one spot trying to wait it out, so I haven’t really noticed my eyes flickering.\n","\n","My partner did say once I looked a bit “weird” for a few seconds when I rolled over in bed, but they didn’t specifically say my eyes were jumping.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T26: 9.22 seconds):\n","How has this been affecting your day-to-day functioning—particularly at work as a nurse (for example, bending, looking up, moving patients, doing meds/notes)—and have you had to change duties or take time off?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T26: 7.45 seconds):\n","It’s definitely getting in the way, mostly because it’s so positional and unpredictable.\n","\n","At work on the acute medical unit I’m bending down a lot—obs, cannulation bits, picking things up, helping with washes—and that motion can set it off if I do it too quickly. Looking up for things on high shelves or reaching for equipment can trigger a spin as well, so I’ve started avoiding that or asking someone else to grab things.\n","\n","The biggest worry for me is moving and handling patients. If I get a spin while I’m supporting someone or doing a turn, I feel like it could be unsafe for them and for me. I’ve not dropped anyone or anything, but I’ve had moments where I’ve had to stop, hold onto the bed/rail, and wait for it to pass. It makes me feel quite anxious.\n","\n","I’m still working, but night shifts are harder because I’m more tired and the dizziness feels worse when I’m getting in and out of bed during the day trying to sleep. I haven’t formally changed duties or taken time off yet, but I’m starting to think I might need to speak to my manager or occupational health if it doesn’t settle soon.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T27: 3.57 seconds):\n","Are you currently driving, and if so have you had any dizziness or near-misses while driving or doing any other safety‑critical activities (for example cycling again, climbing ladders/steps, carrying heavy items)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T27: 5.26 seconds):\n","I am still driving, yes. I’ve been really cautious with it.\n","\n","I haven’t had a spinning episode while I’m actually driving because it seems to be triggered by certain head movements—like rolling in bed, looking up, or bending down—so as long as I keep my head fairly steady it’s okay. But I do feel a bit “off” sometimes, so I’ve been avoiding long drives and I’m extra careful checking mirrors and doing shoulder checks slowly.\n","\n","I haven’t been back on my bike since the fall—I don’t feel confident with the balance side of it at the moment.\n","\n","Safety-wise, I’m also avoiding things like standing on steps to reach high cupboards, and I’m careful carrying anything heavy in case I tip my head the wrong way and set it off.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T28: 5.53 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your thinking—like “brain fog,” slower thinking, trouble concentrating, or new memory lapses?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T28: 2.59 seconds):\n","Not really, no. I feel like my thinking is normal.\n","\n","At work I can concentrate on meds, notes, and handovers like usual, and I’m not noticing any new memory problems. If anything, I’m a bit more tired and distracted because I’m worrying about triggering the dizziness, but it doesn’t feel like “brain fog” or anything cognitive.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T29: 5.94 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any episodes of collapsing or fainting, or any seizure-like events (for example shaking, loss of awareness, tongue-biting, or waking up confused)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T29: 2.17 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I haven’t fainted or collapsed, and I haven’t had any seizure-type episodes—no shaking, no loss of awareness, no tongue-biting, and I haven’t woken up confused.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T30: 7.50 seconds):\n","Before this bike fall, had you ever had anything similar—episodes of room‑spinning vertigo or positional dizziness (even if milder), or any prior inner‑ear problems?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T30: 1.76 seconds):\n","No, never. I’ve had the odd bit of lightheadedness if I stand up too fast like anyone, but I’ve never had proper room-spinning vertigo like this, and I’ve not had any inner-ear issues before.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T31: 4.66 seconds):\n","Have you had any previous head injuries or concussions at any point before this bike fall (even mild ones, like sports knocks or car accidents)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T31: 1.75 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had any previous head injuries or concussions that I’m aware of — no sports knocks, car accidents, or anything like that. This bike fall is the first time I’ve properly bumped my head.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T32: 6.03 seconds):\n","At the time of the bike fall, had you had any alcohol or recreational drugs in the hours beforehand?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T32: 1.40 seconds):\n","No, none at all. I hadn’t been drinking and I don’t use recreational drugs. I was just cycling home like normal.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T33: 4.58 seconds):\n","Do you have any past medical conditions (for example migraine, ear/sinus problems, anemia, thyroid issues, heart rhythm problems), and are you currently taking any regular medications—especially blood thinners like warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or aspirin?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T33: 3.49 seconds):\n","I don’t really have much in my past medical history. I’ve got mild asthma, that’s it. No migraines, no ear or sinus problems, nothing like thyroid issues or heart rhythm problems that I know of.\n","\n","Medication-wise I just use my salbutamol inhaler as needed, and I’ve taken paracetamol occasionally since the fall. I’m not on any blood thinners—no warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban—and I don’t take aspirin regularly. No allergies that I know of either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T34: 9.57 seconds):\n","Do you smoke or vape at all (and how much), and what is your usual alcohol intake in a typical week?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T34: 1.59 seconds):\n","No, I don’t smoke or vape at all.\n","\n","Alcohol-wise, it’s pretty rare for me—maybe a glass of wine or a drink once every couple of weeks, and some weeks nothing at all.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T35: 8.81 seconds):\n","When you roll onto your right side and it triggers the spinning, does the spinning start immediately, or is there a brief delay of a few seconds before it kicks in?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T35: 3.88 seconds):\n","There’s usually a brief delay. Like I’ll roll onto my right side and for a second or two I think I’m okay, and then it suddenly kicks in and the room spins for those 10–20 seconds. If I stay completely still it settles quicker.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T36: 7.81 seconds):\n","If you repeat the same movement a few times in a row (for example rolling to the right side again shortly after an episode), does the spinning tend to get less intense/shorter, or is it about the same each time?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T36: 3.08 seconds):\n","Yeah, actually it does tend to get a bit less intense if I repeat it soon after. Like if I roll to the right, get the spin, then wait for it to pass and try again a minute later, it’s often shorter or not quite as violent. It’s still there, but it feels like it “tires out” a bit.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T37: 8.36 seconds):\n","In the days leading up to when the spinning started (or around when it began), did you have any recent cold/flu symptoms, sinus issues, or an ear infection—anything like blocked ears, ear pain, or a viral illness?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T37: 1.93 seconds):\n","No, I didn’t have any cold or flu around that time. No sinus problems, no blocked ears, and no ear pain or infection that I noticed. It really just seemed to start a couple of days after the bike fall rather than after an illness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T38: 5.90 seconds):\n","When you fell, did your helmet get damaged at all (for example a crack or dent), and did you have any visible injury on your scalp/face like a cut, swelling “goose egg,” or bruising where you hit the right side of your head?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T38: 3.17 seconds):\n","My helmet didn’t crack, but it did get a noticeable scuff and a bit of a dent/scrape on the right side where I hit the ground. I remember checking it when I got home because I was a bit worried.\n","\n","On my head, I didn’t have a cut, but I did get a sore lump—like a “goose egg”—on the right side, and it was a bit bruised/tender for a few days. It went down within about a week.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T39: 13.04 seconds):\n","Before this bike fall, have you ever had any mental health difficulties or diagnoses—such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, or PTSD—at any point in your life?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T39: 2.52 seconds):\n","No, I’ve never had a formal diagnosis or anything like that. I’ve had the normal sort of stress that comes with nursing and life, but I haven’t had anxiety or depression treated, no panic attacks, and no PTSD.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T40: 6.93 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any episodes of becoming unusually drowsy, increasingly confused, or hard to wake up at times?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T40: 1.52 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I’ve been tired from the disrupted sleep, but I haven’t been unusually drowsy, confused, or hard to wake up at any point. My partner hasn’t noticed anything like that either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T41: 13.16 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any new sensitivity to light or noise (for example bright lights bothering you more than usual, or sounds feeling uncomfortably loud)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T41: 1.95 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed that. Bright lights and noise seem normal to me—nothing feels unusually intense or bothersome compared to before the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T42: 6.81 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any change in your sense of smell or taste (for example things smelling “off,” reduced smell, or food tasting different)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T42: 1.47 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed any change in smell or taste. Everything seems normal—food tastes the same and I can smell things as usual.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T43: 7.69 seconds):\n","At home, how is the dizziness affecting your day-to-day activities—things like getting in/out of bed, showering, cooking, housework, or caring responsibilities—and do you have anyone at home helping you?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T43: 7.01 seconds):\n","It’s mostly affecting anything where I have to change position quickly.\n","\n","Getting in and out of bed is the biggest one. If I roll over onto my right side it can set off the spinning, so I’m sort of bracing myself and moving really slowly, and sometimes I’ll just avoid turning that way altogether. If it happens in the night I have to lie still and wait for it to pass, and then I feel a bit shaky afterwards.\n","\n","Showering is mostly okay, but if I tilt my head back to rinse my hair or bend down to pick something up, I can trigger it, so I’m being careful and I’ll hold onto the wall or keep my head level.\n","\n","Cooking and housework—same thing. Bending to lower cupboards, loading the washing machine, picking things up off the floor, looking up to high shelves—those are the movements that can set it off, so I’ve been doing things slower and in stages. I’m not completely unable to do stuff, it’s just more cautious and it takes longer.\n","\n","I live with my partner, and they’ve been helping more—grabbing things from high cupboards, doing some of the heavier chores—especially on days where it’s been more frequent. I don’t have caring responsibilities beyond that.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T44: 4.83 seconds):\n","Do you have any family history of neurological or balance problems—such as recurrent vertigo, migraine, stroke at a young age, or epilepsy/seizures?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T44: 2.53 seconds):\n","Not that I’m aware of. There’s no history of epilepsy or seizures in my family, and no one’s had strokes at a young age.\n","\n","I don’t think there’s a pattern of vertigo or balance problems either. A couple of relatives have the usual things like high blood pressure as they’ve got older, but nothing neurological that I know of.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T45: 3.47 seconds):\n","Have you had any past surgeries or hospital admissions (even unrelated to this injury)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T45: 1.60 seconds):\n","No major surgeries. I’ve never been admitted to hospital as a patient, apart from going in for asthma reviews when I was younger. No operations, no overnight stays, nothing like that.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T46: 12.47 seconds):\n","Have you noticed any new endocrine-type symptoms since the fall—such as unusually increased thirst, drinking much more than normal, needing to urinate much more often (especially overnight), or waking multiple times at night to pass urine?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T46: 2.07 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed anything like that. I’m not unusually thirsty, I’m not drinking more than normal, and I’m not needing to wee more often.\n","\n","If I’m up in the night it’s usually because I’ve rolled the wrong way and set the dizziness off, not because I need the toilet.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T47: 16.63 seconds):\n","Do the spinning episodes ever come on when you’re sitting still (for example sitting on the sofa or standing without moving your head), or do they only happen with specific position changes like rolling over, looking up, or bending down?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T47: 2.10 seconds):\n","No, they don’t come on when I’m just sitting still or standing still. It really seems to only happen with specific position changes—like rolling over in bed (especially onto my right side), looking up, or bending down. If I keep my head still, I’m generally okay.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T48: 6.60 seconds):\n","On a 0–10 scale, where 0 is no dizziness and 10 is the worst imaginable, how intense is the spinning at its worst when it comes on?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T48: 2.47 seconds):\n","When it hits properly, I’d say it’s about an **8 out of 10**. It’s really intense for those 10–20 seconds—like the whole room is spinning—and I feel quite nauseous with it. Between episodes it’s much lower, more like a **1–2 out of 10** “off-balance” feeling.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T49: 13.02 seconds):\n","Aside from the mild right‑sided neck soreness you mentioned, have you had any **new or severe neck pain** since the fall (or any pain shooting down an arm, tingling/numbness in the hands, or weakness) when you move your neck?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T49: 3.96 seconds):\n","No, nothing severe. It’s more a mild ache/stiffness on the right side of my neck, maybe **3/10**, and it hasn’t really got worse.\n","\n","I haven’t had any pain shooting down my arm, no tingling or numbness in my hands, and no weakness when I move my neck—just that local soreness, especially after a long shift.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T50: 13.27 seconds):\n","Have you tried anything so far to manage the dizziness (for example avoiding certain positions, vestibular exercises/“Epley” manoeuvre videos, or any medications for nausea/vertigo), and did any of it change the symptoms?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T50: 5.93 seconds):\n","Mostly I’ve just been avoiding the movements that set it off. So I try not to roll onto my right side in bed, and I move really slowly if I have to bend down or look up. That helps a bit in the sense that I can trigger it less often, but it hasn’t made it go away.\n","\n","I did look up some videos about the Epley manoeuvre because a colleague mentioned “crystals in the ear,” but I haven’t properly tried it. I was a bit nervous about making it worse or doing it wrong, especially with my neck feeling a bit sore.\n","\n","Medication-wise, I’ve only taken paracetamol for the neck ache/headache early on. I haven’t taken anything specific for vertigo or nausea.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T51: 12.44 seconds):\n","When the spinning comes on, do you ever feel like you might **faint** (for example greying/blackening of vision, sweating, palpitations, or needing to sit/lie down), or is it purely a **room-spinning** sensation without that “about to pass out” feeling?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T51: 2.71 seconds):\n","It feels like **pure room-spinning**, not like I’m about to faint.\n","\n","I don’t get greying or blacking out of my vision, and I don’t get palpitations or that sweaty “I’m going to pass out” feeling. It’s more that the spin hits, I feel quite nauseous, and I have to **freeze and hold onto something** or lie still until it settles.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T52: 8.17 seconds):\n","When you’ve been feeling more anxious and on edge since this started, have you had **any thoughts of harming yourself or feeling that you wouldn’t want to be here**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T52: 2.88 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I haven’t had any thoughts of harming myself or not wanting to be here.\n","\n","I’ve been anxious and a bit on edge because the spinning is horrible and it worries me, but it hasn’t gone into that territory. If anything I just want it sorted so I can feel safe at work and sleep properly again.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T53: 10.88 seconds):\n","When you first **sit up from lying down** (for example getting out of bed), does that also trigger the room‑spinning— or is it mainly with **rolling to the right / looking up / bending down**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T53: 2.43 seconds):\n","Sitting up from lying down doesn’t usually trigger the full room-spinning for me.\n","\n","It’s mainly **rolling over to the right**, **looking up** (like to a high shelf), or **bending down**. Occasionally when I sit up quickly I might feel a bit off-balance for a moment, but not the same proper spinning episode.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T54: 14.02 seconds):\n","After the fall, did you have **any bleeding or clear fluid** from your **nose or either ear**, or any new bruising around the eyes/behind the ear?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T54: 1.71 seconds):\n","No, none of that. I didn’t have any bleeding or clear fluid from my nose or ears, and I didn’t get bruising around my eyes or behind my ear—just that sore lump and a bit of bruising where I hit the right side of my head.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T55: 16.47 seconds):\n","Before this bike fall, did you have any prior **neck problems** (for example arthritis, disc issues, previous whiplash), or was your neck generally fine?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T55: 2.31 seconds):\n","My neck was generally fine before the fall. I’ve never had whiplash, disc problems, or anything like arthritis that I know of. Just the usual bit of stiffness now and then after a long shift, but nothing ongoing or needing treatment.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T56: 7.84 seconds):\n","Can you tell me more about the fall itself—how you went down and exactly how your head made contact with the ground (for example, did you slide, go over the handlebars, land on your shoulder/hip first, and what surface was it)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T56: 4.80 seconds):\n","Yeah. I was cycling along a shared path and it was a bit damp, and my front wheel skidded when I tried to slow and turn slightly. It wasn’t like I went flying over the handlebars or anything dramatic — more that the bike slid out from under me and I sort of toppled to the right.\n","\n","I remember putting an arm out instinctively, and I landed on my right side. I think my right hip and shoulder took some of it, but my head still knocked the ground as well — the right side, kind of above and behind my ear, on the parietal area. The surface was a normal paved path/asphalt. My helmet hit and got scuffed on that side, and I had a lump there afterwards.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T57: 15.87 seconds):\n","Overall since it started 2–3 days after the fall, has the dizziness been **gradually improving, worsening, or staying about the same**—and have you had any full days where it was completely gone?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T57: 3.86 seconds):\n","It’s been **staying about the same**, to be honest. It hasn’t really steadily improved or anything—some days feel a bit better if I’m careful and move slowly, but the pattern is still there.\n","\n","I **haven’t had any full days where it’s completely gone**. Even on a “good” day, if I roll onto my right side or look up the wrong way, it’ll still set it off.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T58: 17.21 seconds):\n","When you roll over in bed onto your **left** side, does that trigger the spinning as well, or is it only (or much worse) when you roll onto your **right** side?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T58: 2.30 seconds):\n","Rolling onto my **left** side doesn’t usually trigger it. It’s **mostly on the right**, and it’s definitely **much worse** when I roll onto my right side. Occasionally I might feel a tiny bit “off” if I move awkwardly to the left, but it’s not the same proper room-spinning episode.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T59: 14.40 seconds):\n","How has this affected your social life and usual exercise or hobbies since the fall (for example seeing friends, gym, walking, cycling), and have you been avoiding anything because you’re worried it might trigger the spinning?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T59: 6.04 seconds):\n","It’s definitely had an impact. I’ve been avoiding quite a few things because I’m worried about setting the spinning off, or about losing my balance.\n","\n","I haven’t been back on my bike at all since the fall. That was my main way of getting about and a bit of exercise, and right now I just don’t feel confident with my balance. I’m still walking, like to the shops and around the house, but I’m more cautious—turning my head quickly or looking up can make me feel like it might trigger it, so I’m a bit slower and more careful.\n","\n","Socially, I’ve still seen my partner and a couple of close friends, but I’ve turned down a few things—like going out somewhere busy or crowded—because I’m tired from broken sleep and I don’t want to feel dizzy in public.

I had a mild headache for the rest of that day, but the main issue since then has been this positional dizziness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T2: 3.93 seconds):\n","To help me keep your history clear and accurate, what name would you like me to use?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T2: 1.60 seconds):\n","Aisha is fine, thank you.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T3: 2.97 seconds):\n","How old are you, Aisha?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T3: 0.90 seconds):\n","I’m 35.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T4: 1.44 seconds):\n","What sex were you assigned at birth (female or male)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T4: 0.96 seconds):\n","Female.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T5: 2.55 seconds):\n","Are you right-handed, left-handed, or do you use both about equally?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T5: 0.73 seconds):\n","I’m right-handed.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T6: 3.79 seconds):\n","How many years of education have you completed (roughly), Aisha?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T6: 4.33 seconds):\n","I did A-levels and then a three-year nursing degree, so roughly about 16 years of education altogether.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T7: 2.44 seconds):\n","When exactly did the fall happen (the date, and roughly what time of day)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T7: 3.97 seconds):\n","It was about three weeks ago now—on Wednesday the 17th of December, late afternoon, around 4 or 5pm.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T8: 4.39 seconds):\n","When you fell, did you have any immediate symptoms in the first minutes to hours—like feeling dazed/confused, nausea, vomiting, neck pain, or trouble with your vision?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T8: 4.81 seconds):\n","Right after I went down I was definitely shaken up, but I didn’t feel confused or dazed, and I didn’t black out. I didn’t vomit or anything like that.\n","\n","I had a bit of a headache that came on soon after and lasted the rest of the day—more like a mild ache. My vision was fine, no double vision or anything. My neck felt a bit sore on the right side, but it wasn’t severe at the time.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T9: 4.22 seconds):\n","When did the spinning dizziness first start after the fall—immediately that day, or did it come on later (and if later, how many days after)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T9: 1.82 seconds):\n","It didn’t start straight away. The spinning feeling came on a couple of days later—maybe 2 to 3 days after the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T10: 3.03 seconds):\n","When you get the spinning, how long does each episode last once you roll over or look up—seconds, minutes, or longer?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T10: 1.58 seconds):\n","It’s seconds, not minutes. Usually about 10 to 20 seconds of proper room-spinning once I roll over—especially to the right—or if I look up. Then it settles if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T11: 5.44 seconds):\n","When the spinning comes on, do you also feel nauseated or have you vomited with any of the episodes?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T11: 1.56 seconds):\n","Yeah, I feel pretty nauseated when it happens—like my stomach lurches—but I haven’t actually vomited from it. It passes once the spinning stops and I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T12: 4.09 seconds):\n","Have you noticed any changes in your hearing since the fall—like ringing (tinnitus), muffled hearing, or a feeling of fullness/pressure in either ear?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T12: 0.99 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. My hearing feels normal—no ringing, no muffled hearing, and no fullness or pressure in either ear.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T13: 3.20 seconds):\n","Have you been seen by any healthcare professional for this since the fall (for example a GP, urgent care, or Emergency Department), and if so what did they do or find (any examination or scans like a CT/MRI)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T13: 2.27 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t been seen yet. I thought it might just settle on its own at first, and I’ve been trying to manage around work.\n","\n","I haven’t had any scans or anything like that—no CT or MRI. This is the first proper time I’m talking it through with someone.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T14: 4.14 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any other symptoms that concern you—such as a severe or worsening headache, double vision or other vision changes, weakness or numbness in an arm/leg, slurred speech, increasing drowsiness, or any episodes that looked like a seizure?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T14: 2.20 seconds):\n","No, none of those, thankfully.\n","\n","The headache was just mild that first day and it didn’t get worse. I haven’t had double vision or any vision changes, no weakness or numbness, no slurred speech, and I’m not unusually drowsy. And I haven’t had anything like a seizure.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T15: 5.20 seconds):\n","Between these brief spinning episodes, do you feel completely back to normal, or do you have any ongoing unsteadiness/lightheadedness even when you’re sitting or walking around?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T15: 3.66 seconds):\n","Between the actual spinning episodes I’m mostly okay, like I can function and I’m not constantly dizzy. But I wouldn’t say I feel completely back to normal either—I’ve got this slight “off-balance” feeling in the background, especially if I’m moving around a lot or turning quickly.\n","\n","If I’m just sitting still, I’m generally fine. It’s more when I’m up and about that I notice I’m a bit unsteady, but it’s not the full room-spinning unless I trigger it by rolling over, looking up, or bending.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T16: 4.73 seconds):\n","How often are you getting these spinning episodes now (for example, times per day or per week), and have any of them caused you to stumble or fall?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T16: 3.40 seconds):\n","At the moment it’s happening multiple times a day—probably around 6 to 8 times a day, depending on what I’m doing.\n","\n","I haven’t actually fallen, but I’ve definitely had a couple of moments where I’ve had to grab onto something or stop and steady myself, especially if I’ve rolled over in bed and then tried to sit up too quickly. I’m being really cautious because it feels like it could catch me out.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T17: 4.27 seconds):\n","Can you tell me more about exactly which positions trigger the spinning most—especially whether it’s consistently worse when you roll onto your right side compared with your left, and whether it also happens when you sit up from lying down?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T17: 3.61 seconds):\n","Yeah—there are a few really specific triggers.\n","\n","The most consistent one is rolling over in bed onto my **right** side. If I roll to the left it can feel a bit off, but it’s definitely **worse and more reliable** on the right. Looking **up**—like reaching to a high shelf—or **bending down** and then coming back up can set it off too.\n","\n","Sitting up from lying down can sometimes bring on a brief spin, but it’s usually after I’ve rolled or moved my head a certain way first. If I move slowly and keep my head kind of neutral, I can sometimes avoid it or make it less intense.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T18: 4.93 seconds):\n","Over the last three weeks, has the positional spinning been getting better, worse, or staying about the same overall?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T18: 1.89 seconds):\n","I’d say it’s been **about the same overall**, maybe very slightly less intense than right at the start, but it’s still happening most days and it’s still really positional. I keep thinking it’ll just go away, but it hasn’t properly settled yet.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T19: 4.66 seconds):\n","At the time of the fall and right after it, did you have any gaps in your memory—either for the moments just before the crash or for what happened in the minutes/hours afterwards?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T19: 1.72 seconds):\n","No, I don’t think so. I remember skidding, going down, and hitting the right side of my head, and I remember getting myself up afterwards and sorting myself out. There aren’t any blank spots from just before or after it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T20: 4.01 seconds):\n","Did you have any other injuries from the fall—such as a cut or bump on the scalp, facial injury, or significant neck pain that persisted in the days afterward?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T20: 2.76 seconds):\n","I did have a bit of a bump and tenderness on the right side of my head where I hit it, but no cut that needed anything—no bleeding or stitches or anything like that, and no facial injury.\n","\n","My neck was sore afterwards, mostly on the right side. It’s persisted on and off since then, but it’s fairly mild — like a 3 out of 10 — more of an ache and stiffness than sharp pain. It hasn’t stopped me moving my neck, it’s just uncomfortable at times.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T21: 3.92 seconds):\n","Are you having any headaches now (not just the first day)—and if so, how often and how severe are they (0–10)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T21: 2.39 seconds):\n","Not really, no. The headache was mainly just that first day after the fall and it was mild.\n","\n","Since then I haven’t had ongoing headaches. If I do get one it’s very occasional and mild—maybe a 1–2 out of 10—and I’ve mostly just put that down to being tired or a bit tense with my neck.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T22: 3.92 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your sleep or fatigue—for example trouble falling asleep, waking more in the night, sleeping more than usual, or feeling unusually tired during the day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T22: 3.60 seconds):\n","Yeah, a bit. I wouldn’t say I’m sleeping loads more than usual, but my sleep’s been more broken because if I roll over in bed—especially onto my right—I can trigger the spinning and it wakes me up and makes me feel queasy for a few seconds.\n","\n","I’ve also felt more tired than I normally would, especially on night shifts. Part of it is probably just being a bit on edge about the dizziness and moving more carefully, but I do feel more fatigued during the day than usual.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T23: 5.49 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your thinking—like “brain fog,” slower thinking, trouble concentrating, or memory problems (for example forgetting conversations, misplacing things more than usual)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T23: 3.13 seconds):\n","Not really in a big way, no. I don’t feel like I’ve got “brain fog” or that I’m forgetting whole conversations.\n","\n","I do feel a bit more distractible and tired, but I think that’s mostly because my sleep’s been interrupted and I’m sort of bracing myself for the dizziness. At work I can concentrate and do my notes as normal—I’m just more cautious and a bit anxious about sudden movements.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T24: 3.71 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your mood or anxiety—such as feeling more anxious (including panic symptoms), low in mood, or more irritable than usual?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T24: 3.66 seconds):\n","Yeah, I’ve definitely been more anxious than usual. It’s the unpredictability of it—like I’ll roll over or look up and suddenly the room spins—so I’m kind of on edge anticipating it.\n","\n","I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but I have felt a bit low and frustrated at times because it’s dragging on and it’s affecting sleep and work. I’ve also been a bit more snappy/irritable with my partner than normal, mostly when I’m tired.\n","\n","No full-on panic attacks, but I do get that anxious “what if something serious is going on in my brain?” feeling, especially when it happens at night.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T25: 4.41 seconds):\n","When you’ve been feeling low or anxious since the fall, have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, or that you’d be better off not here?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T25: 2.57 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I haven’t had any thoughts about harming myself or not wanting to be here.\n","\n","It’s more that I feel worried and fed up with it, and I get a bit tearful or stressed sometimes, but I’m not feeling suicidal. If anything I’m just keen to get it sorted so I can feel safe and normal again.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T26: 3.36 seconds):\n","Before this cycling fall, have you ever had any previous head injuries or concussions (even mild ones, including sports injuries or childhood knocks)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T26: 2.46 seconds):\n","No, not really. I’ve never been diagnosed with a concussion or anything like that before.\n","\n","I’ve had the usual minor knocks over the years—like bumping my head on a cupboard door—but nothing that needed medical attention or gave me symptoms like this. This is the first time I’ve had this kind of spinning afterwards.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T27: 4.03 seconds):\n","Before this fall, did you have any history of dizziness/vertigo or inner-ear problems (for example BPPV, vestibular neuritis, recurrent “spins,” or significant motion sickness)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T27: 1.99 seconds):\n","No, I didn’t.\n","\n","I’ve never had vertigo or those “room spinning” episodes before this. No inner-ear problems that I know of, no BPPV diagnosis, and no vestibular neuritis. I’m not particularly motion-sick either—maybe a bit if I’m reading in the car, but nothing significant.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T28: 4.63 seconds):\n","Are you currently taking any regular medications or supplements (including anything “as needed”), and in particular are you on any blood thinners like warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, or daily aspirin?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T28: 2.08 seconds):\n","I only take a **salbutamol inhaler** for mild asthma.\n","\n","And then just **paracetamol as needed**—I’ve taken that a few times for the neck ache.\n","\n","No supplements, and I’m **not** on any blood thinners—no warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, or daily aspirin.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T29: 4.01 seconds):\n","Do you have any medication allergies (or other significant allergies), and if so what reaction do you get?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T29: 1.18 seconds):\n","No, I don’t have any known drug allergies. I’ve not had any significant allergic reactions to medications that I’m aware of.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T30: 5.74 seconds):\n","At the time of the fall, had you had any alcohol or recreational drugs in your system (even a small amount)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T30: 1.47 seconds):\n","No, none. I hadn’t had any alcohol that day, and I don’t use recreational drugs.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T31: 4.51 seconds):\n","Apart from mild asthma, do you have any other past medical conditions—especially anything neurological (like migraines, seizures, stroke), or mental health conditions (like anxiety or depression)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T31: 2.70 seconds):\n","No, not really. Apart from mild asthma I’m generally pretty healthy.\n","\n","I don’t have any neurological conditions—no migraines, no seizures, no stroke/TIA history. And I’ve never had a diagnosed mental health condition like anxiety or depression. I do get stressed like anyone with work, but nothing that’s needed treatment before.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T32: 4.53 seconds):\n","How has this dizziness affected your day-to-day functioning—especially your nursing work (for example, have you missed shifts, changed duties, or avoided certain tasks like bending, turning quickly, or moving patients)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T32: 4.93 seconds):\n","It’s definitely getting in the way, especially at work.\n","\n","On the ward I’m finding I’m avoiding anything that involves sudden head movements—so things like bending down to pick things up, looking up for equipment on high shelves, or turning quickly between bed spaces. I’m extra careful when I’m doing obs or checking lines because if I tip my head the wrong way I can trigger that spin and nausea for a few seconds.\n","\n","I haven’t actually missed a shift yet, but night shifts have been harder because my sleep’s already disrupted from it happening when I roll over in bed. And I do feel less safe with moving and handling—like helping a heavier patient stand or pivot—because I’m worried I could get a spin at the wrong moment. So I’m more likely to ask a colleague for help or take things more slowly than I normally would.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T33: 2.97 seconds):\n","Are you currently driving since the fall, and if so have you had any dizziness while driving or doing other safety‑critical things (for example cycling again, using stairs, or handling patients)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T33: 4.97 seconds):\n","I have been driving, yes, but I’m being really cautious.\n","\n","I haven’t had the spinning while I’m actually driving because it seems to be triggered by certain head positions—like rolling over in bed, looking up, or bending—so if I keep my head fairly still it’s okay. That said, I do feel a bit “off-balance” at times between episodes, so I’ve been avoiding longer drives and I don’t drive if I’m feeling particularly unsettled.\n","\n","I haven’t cycled again since the fall. Stairs are mostly fine, but I hold the handrail and go slower, especially if I’ve just had an episode. And at work with handling patients, that’s the bit that worries me most—I’m trying not to do anything that involves sudden turns or bending without someone nearby, because I’d feel awful if I got a spin mid-move.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T34: 5.04 seconds):\n","Do you currently smoke or vape (or have you in the past), and if so how much?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T34: 1.70 seconds):\n","No, I don’t smoke or vape, and I never really have.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T35: 5.50 seconds):\n","Outside of the day of the fall, what is your usual alcohol intake in a typical week (if any)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T35: 1.54 seconds):\n","I hardly drink, to be honest. Maybe a glass of wine or a cocktail once in a while—certainly not every week. On a typical week it’s usually nothing.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T36: 5.80 seconds):\n","When the spinning happens, have you noticed your eyes “jumping” or flickering (or has anyone else observed that), or does your vision stay steady aside from the sensation of the room spinning?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T36: 4.48 seconds):\n","I haven’t personally noticed my eyes flickering, but when it happens my vision does feel like it’s “moving” because the whole room seems to spin.\n","\n","My partner did mention once when I rolled over in bed and got a bad one, it looked like my eyes were sort of darting for a few seconds—like they were “wobbling”—and then it stopped when the spinning stopped. I don’t know if that’s what you mean.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T37: 8.29 seconds):\n","When the dizziness comes on, does it ever feel like you might **faint or black out** (lightheadedness/“about to pass out”), or is it **always a true spinning/room-spinning sensation**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T37: 2.39 seconds):\n","It feels like **proper spinning**, like the room is rotating for a few seconds.  \n","\n","I don’t feel like I’m going to **faint** or black out with it—no greying out, no “about to pass out” lightheadedness. It’s very specifically that sudden **vertigo** when I move my head a certain way, and then it settles if I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T38: 5.88 seconds):\n","During the spinning episodes themselves, do you ever get **double vision** or any other visual change (even briefly), or is it just the sensation that the room is spinning?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T38: 1.93 seconds):\n","It’s basically just the sensation of the room spinning. I don’t get double vision.\n","\n","My vision can feel a bit “swimmy” *because* everything seems to be moving for those few seconds, but once the spinning stops my vision is normal again—no blurring or lasting changes.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T39: 10.91 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any change in your **sense of smell or taste** (for example foods smelling different, reduced smell, or a strange metallic taste)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T39: 1.50 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed any change in my smell or taste. Food tastes normal, and I can smell things the same as before—no weird metallic taste or anything like that.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T40: 6.12 seconds):\n","In the days leading up to the dizziness starting (or around the time of the fall), did you have any recent viral illness or ear symptoms—like a cold/flu, fever, ear pain, or ear discharge?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T40: 2.02 seconds):\n","No, I didn’t have anything like that. I wasn’t getting over a cold or flu, no fever, and I didn’t have any ear pain or discharge. It really just seemed to start a couple of days after the fall rather than around an illness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T41: 11.45 seconds):\n","Have you tried anything to manage the dizziness so far—such as any medications for nausea/dizziness, or any exercises/movements to “reset” it—and did any of that help or make it worse?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T41: 3.55 seconds):\n","I haven’t really taken anything specific for dizziness or nausea—no prochlorperazine or cyclizine or anything like that. I’ve just used paracetamol a few times for the neck ache.\n","\n","What I *have* been doing is basically trying to manage it by moving really slowly and avoiding the triggers. Like, in bed I try not to roll onto my right, and I’ll sit up in stages. If I keep still once it starts, it settles quicker. If I move my head again while it’s happening it definitely feels worse. I’ve not tried any proper “reset” exercises because I’m worried about making it worse or doing the wrong thing.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T42: 11.00 seconds):\n","When you hit the right side of your head, did your helmet show any damage afterwards (for example a crack or dent), and did you hit anything else on the way down (like a kerb/rail) or just the flat ground?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T42: 2.52 seconds):\n","I checked my helmet afterwards and I didn’t see any obvious crack. There might’ve been a bit of scuffing on the side, but no big dent that I noticed.\n","\n","I didn’t hit a kerb or anything sharp—just the flat path/ground when I went down, and it was the right side of my head that took the knock.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T43: 11.91 seconds):\n","Who do you currently live with at home, and do you have someone who can help you if the dizziness hits (for example at night or on the stairs)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T43: 2.32 seconds):\n","I live with my partner. They’ve been really supportive—if I get a bad spin at night they’ll sit up with me for a moment and make sure I’m steady.  \n","\n","I’m generally okay day to day, but it’s reassuring having someone there, especially with the night-time episodes and if I’m going up and down the stairs when I’m feeling a bit off.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T44: 11.51 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any unusually increased thirst or needing to pass urine much more often than normal (especially getting up multiple times at night to pee)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T44: 2.54 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. My thirst feels normal and I’m not needing to pass urine more than usual, and I’m not getting up multiple times in the night to pee — it’s more that I wake up if I roll over and set the spinning off.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T45: 4.49 seconds):\n","Have you had any past surgeries or hospital admissions before this (even things like tonsils, appendix, C‑section), and roughly when were they?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T45: 2.07 seconds):\n","No major surgeries. I’ve never had an appendix out or anything like that, and no C‑sections.\n","\n","I’ve only ever been admitted once as a kid for asthma observation overnight, but that was years ago. Other than that, it’s just been routine GP stuff.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T46: 6.29 seconds):\n","Do you have any family history of neurological problems—like migraines, epilepsy/seizures, stroke at a young age, or significant balance/vertigo problems?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T46: 2.14 seconds):\n","Not that I’m aware of.\n","\n","My parents are generally healthy—no epilepsy or anything like that. There’s no history of stroke at a young age in the family. And I don’t think anyone has significant balance problems or recurrent vertigo.\n","\n","I do have a couple of relatives who get the odd headache, but no diagnosed migraines that I know of.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T47: 16.27 seconds):\n","When you’re **upright** (standing or walking), does turning your head **to the right or left** trigger the same brief room-spinning, or is it mainly with **lying down/rolling over, looking up, or bending**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T47: 2.59 seconds):\n","It’s mainly with **lying down/rolling over**, **looking up**, or **bending**.\n","\n","When I’m upright and walking around, turning my head right or left doesn’t usually set off that same sudden room-spinning. I might feel a bit off-balance if I turn quickly, but it’s not the proper spinning vertigo unless it’s one of those specific positions.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T48: 9.99 seconds):\n","Just to confirm, Aisha: what **year** did the fall happen (was it December **2025**)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T48: 1.03 seconds):\n","Yes — it was December **2025**, three weeks ago.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T49: 9.41 seconds):\n","Has the dizziness affected your basic day‑to‑day activities at home—things like getting in/out of bed, showering/washing your hair, dressing, or cooking—and if so, which parts are hardest?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T49: 5.72 seconds):\n","Yes, it has, mainly because it’s so position‑dependent.\n","\n","- **Getting in and out of bed** is probably the worst. Rolling over—especially onto my right—can set it off, so I’m really careful and I sort of move in stages now. Nights are frustrating because it can wake me up.\n","- **Showering/washing my hair** can trigger it if I tilt my head back to rinse, so I’ve been avoiding leaning my head back and I’ll bend forward instead, or I’ll do it more slowly.\n","- **Dressing** is mostly fine, but if I bend down quickly for socks or shoes I can get a brief spin, so I sit down to do those now.\n","- **Cooking/house stuff**—reaching up to high cupboards or looking up for things can trigger it, and bending to lower cupboards/bin can as well, so I’m just moving slower and using a step stool less.\n","\n","I can still do everything, it just takes more time and I’m more cautious because I don’t want it to hit when I’m standing or holding something hot.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T50: 11.16 seconds):\n","During the spinning episodes (or shortly after), do you ever get **migraine-type symptoms**—for example a headache, **sensitivity to light or sound**, or any visual aura (like zig-zag lines or flashing lights)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T50: 1.85 seconds):\n","No, not really. I don’t get a headache with the spinning episodes, and I’m not especially sensitive to light or sound afterwards.\n","\n","I also haven’t had any visual aura stuff like zig-zags or flashing lights. It’s more just the brief room-spinning and a wave of nausea, then it settles once I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T51: 9.58 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any **neck-related nerve symptoms**—for example **tingling, numbness, or shooting pain** into either arm/hand (or any new clumsiness with your hands)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T51: 1.90 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had anything like that.\n","\n","My neck is just a bit sore and stiff on the right side, but I’m not getting tingling, numbness, or any shooting pain down either arm, and my hands feel normal—no new clumsiness.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T52: 10.81 seconds):\n","On a 0–10 scale, where 0 is no dizziness and 10 is the worst you can imagine, how intense is the **room‑spinning** at its worst during an episode?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T52: 1.94 seconds):\n","At its worst, I’d say it’s about a **7 out of 10**. It’s really unpleasant and makes me feel quite nauseated, but because it only lasts **10–20 seconds** it’s not like it stays at that level for ages.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T53: 15.35 seconds):\n","Is there anything else you think I should know about your injury or how you’ve been feeling? Do you have any questions for me right now?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T53: 6.11 seconds):\n","I think the main thing is just how **specific and brief** it is — it’s not like I’m dizzy all day. It’s those **10–20 seconds of proper room-spinning** when I roll onto my **right** in bed, look up, or bend, and then it settles if I keep still. In between I’m mostly okay, just a bit “off” and cautious.\n","\n","I suppose what I want to flag is the **impact on work and safety** — I can still do my job, but I feel less confident with **moving and handling** or doing anything where I might suddenly have to look up or turn quickly, especially on nights when I’m more tired.\n","\n","In terms of questions:  \n","- Does this sound like something **inner-ear/positional** rather than “something in my brain”? That’s my big worry.  \n","- Is there something you can do to **reset it** — like a manoeuvre or exercises — and is it safe given I bumped my head?  \n","- And do I need any kind of **scan** at this point, or would you only do that if I had other symptoms?\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T54: 18.45 seconds):\n","I hear those worries and questions, and I’ll make sure they’re clearly noted for the treating clinician—but I can’t answer them myself here.\n","\n","To understand the **work/safety** impact a bit better: have you told your manager/occupational health about the dizziness, and have you had any near-misses at work (for example almost dropping something hot/sharp, or feeling unsteady during a patient move)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T54: 6.41 seconds):\n","I haven’t told my manager or occupational health yet. I think I’ve been hoping it would just go away and I didn’t want to make a fuss or get taken off shifts if it’s something that can be sorted.\n","\n","In terms of near-misses—nothing dramatic like dropping a needle or anything, but there have been a couple of moments that felt a bit too close for comfort:\n","\n","- Once I bent down to pick something up from a low drawer and got that sudden spin when I straightened up. I had to grab the trolley to steady myself for a few seconds.\n","- Another time I was helping reposition a patient and I turned my head quickly to check the monitor/lines and I got a brief wave of vertigo and nausea. I stopped and got a colleague to take over for a moment so I didn’t risk losing my balance.\n","\n","So no actual incidents or harm, but I do feel like it *could* become one if it hits at the wrong moment—especially with heavier patients or if I’m on nights and more fatigued.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T55: 10.42 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any **stress‑reaction/PTSD‑type symptoms**—for example **intrusive memories** of the crash, **nightmares**, feeling very on-edge in similar situations, or **avoiding** things because they remind you of it (beyond avoiding positions that trigger the spinning)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T55: 2.91 seconds):\n","I wouldn’t say PTSD-type, no.\n","\n","I don’t have intrusive memories or flashbacks of the fall, and I’m not having nightmares about it. I do feel a bit more on-edge generally, but it’s mostly because I’m anticipating the dizziness happening rather than reliving the crash.\n","\n","I *have* been avoiding cycling since it happened, partly because I’m worried about getting dizzy and having another accident, and partly just because it knocked my confidence a bit. But I’m not avoiding places or situations because they remind me of the crash itself.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T56: 10.72 seconds):\n","Can you tell me more about the circumstances of the bike fall itself—where you were riding, roughly how fast you were going, and whether you hit anything/someone or it was just the skid onto the flat ground?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T56: 5.16 seconds):\n","I was riding on a paved shared path near my area—just a normal cycle route, not on the road. It was daylight, late afternoon.\n","\n","I wasn’t going fast at all, just kind of steady/slow—maybe jogging pace, like 8–10 miles an hour at most. I remember the front wheel skidding out a bit, I lost balance, and I just went down onto the flat ground.\n","\n","I didn’t hit anyone else and I didn’t collide with a bike/vehicle or anything like a railing. It was really just the skid and the fall onto the path, and I landed awkwardly and knocked the right side of my head even though I had my helmet on.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T57: 12.73 seconds):\n","When you roll onto your right side or look up and it triggers an episode, does the spinning start **immediately**, or is there a **brief delay of a few seconds** before it begins—and if you repeat the same movement again soon after, does it tend to be **less intense** the second time (or about the same)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T57: 3.38 seconds):\n","There’s usually a **brief delay** — not long, but a couple of seconds after I roll onto my right or tip my head back, and then the spinning kicks in.\n","\n","And yes, if I do the same movement again soon after, it often feels **a bit less intense the second time**. It’s like the first one is the worst, and then it sort of “settles” a little if I repeat it—although it still happens, so I’m trying not to keep provoking it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T58: 20.53 seconds):\n","Do you have any other questions for me right now?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T58: 3.57 seconds):\n","Just a couple, mainly about what happens next:\n","\n","1) What’s the next step in the assessment—will someone be doing specific positional tests (like moving my head/lying me back) to try to reproduce it and check my eye movements?\n","\n","2) If it is something positional/inner-ear, is there usually a treatment that can be done the same day, or would I be referred to physio/ENT?\n","\n","3) While I’m waiting to be seen, is it safer for me to keep working as normal, or should I be speaking to my manager/occ health about temporary adjustments—especially for moving and handling and night shifts?\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T59: 8.90 seconds):\n","I’ve noted those questions for the treating clinician. I can’t answer them directly here, but it’s helpful to understand what your day-to-day risk looks like while this is ongoing.\n","\n","Can you tell me what your **current role and typical shifts** are (e.g., ward type, days vs nights, moving/handling frequency), and whether your workplace has any **light‑duty/modified duties** options if needed?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T59: 7.05 seconds):\n","I’m a staff nurse on an **acute medical unit**—so it’s pretty fast-paced, lots of turnover and unwell patients.\n","\n","My shifts are usually **12.5 hours** and it’s a mix of **days and nights**, depending on the rota. Lately I’ve had a fair few nights, which is probably why it’s feeling harder because my sleep’s already getting interrupted by the spinning when I roll over.\n","\n","In a typical shift there’s a lot of **moving and handling**—helping patients sit up, stand, transfer to commodes/chairs, repositioning in bed, plus things like doing obs, ECGs, cannulas, meds, fetching equipment. I’m constantly **bending**, **turning**, and **looking up** for things in cupboards, so it’s not really a job where you can avoid those movements.\n","\n","We do have options for **modified duties**, but it depends on staffing. Like, I could potentially be more in the “coordinator” role, do more paperwork/phone calls/discharges, or be allocated lighter patients, and I can ask for help with heavier moves. Occupational health is there, but I haven’t contacted them yet, and I haven’t formally asked my manager about light duties—I’ve just been quietly adapting and leaning on colleagues when I need to.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T60: 12.85 seconds):\n","Outside of work, how has this affected your usual **exercise and leisure activities**—for example walking, gym, running, yoga, socialising—and have you been avoiding anything besides cycling?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T60: 5.28 seconds):\n","I’ve cut back a fair bit.\n","\n","I’m still **walking**, like to the shops or just locally, but I’m more cautious and I won’t do anything too brisk if I’m feeling a bit “off.” I’ve not been to the **gym** since it started because I’m worried things like lying back on a bench, burpees, or anything with quick head movements will set it off. I’ve also avoided **yoga** because the bending/looking up/down (downward dog, etc.) feels like it would trigger it.\n","\n","Socialising-wise I’m still seeing friends, but I’ve been a bit more tired and I’ll avoid anything that’s likely to make me feel worse—like being out late before a shift. And besides cycling, I’ve also been avoiding things like climbing on a stool to reach high cupboards at home, just because looking up can set the spins off and it feels unsafe.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T61: 7.63 seconds):\n","Have you had any **actual falls or injuries** since the dizziness started (at home or at work), even if minor—such as falling on the stairs, in the shower, or when getting out of bed?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T61: 2.67 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t actually fallen or injured myself since it started.\n","\n","I’ve had a couple of moments where I’ve felt like I *could*—like when I’ve rolled over in bed and then sat up too quickly, or once when I stood up after bending down—but I’ve managed to grab onto something or just freeze until it passes. I’ve been really careful on the stairs and in the shower for that reason.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T62: 10.88 seconds):\n","When you are **completely still** (for example lying on your back with your head supported, or sitting upright without moving your head), do you ever get the **room-spinning vertigo** anyway, or does it **only** happen after a head position change like rolling, looking up, or bending?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T62: 2.21 seconds):\n","No—if I’m completely still, I don’t get the room-spinning.\n","\n","It only comes on **after** I change my head position, like **rolling over (especially onto my right)**, **looking up**, or **bending**. If I keep still once it starts, it settles within those few seconds and then I’m okay again.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T63: 2.76 seconds):\n","When you’re completely still, it sounds like you **don’t** get the room-spinning at all, and it **only** comes on after specific head position changes (rolling to the **right**, looking up, bending), then settles within **10–20 seconds** if you keep still.\n","\n","Can you tell me: when you **lie flat on your back** and then **turn your head to the right** (without rolling your whole body), does that also trigger the spinning, or is it only when you actually **roll your body** onto the right side?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T63: 3.09 seconds):\n","If I’m lying flat on my back and I **just turn my head to the right**, that **can** trigger it as well — it’s not only when I fully roll my whole body onto my right side.\n","\n","Rolling onto the right is definitely the most reliable way to set it off, but even just turning my head right when I’m lying down can bring on that brief spin, especially if I do it a bit quickly. If I move really slowly it’s sometimes less intense.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T64: 1.64 seconds):\n","When you’re lying on your back and you turn your head to the right and it triggers it, is there also a **brief delay of a couple of seconds** before the spinning starts, and does it again **ease if you repeat it** soon after?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T64: 2.93 seconds):\n","Yes—when I’m on my back and I turn my head to the right, there’s still that **brief delay**, like a couple of seconds, and then the spinning starts.\n","\n","And if I repeat it again soon after, it often does seem to **ease a bit** the second time. It’s still there, but it feels less intense than the first one.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T65: 2.65 seconds):\n","When you’re lying on your back and turn your head to the right, you still get a **couple‑second delay** before the spinning starts, and it often feels **less intense if you repeat it** soon after.\n","\n","One more question: when an episode is triggered, do you find the spinning is always in the **same direction** (for example always feels like the room spins to the right vs to the left), or does the direction vary?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T65: 2.05 seconds):\n","It’s pretty consistent.\n","\n","When it comes on, it feels like the room is spinning in the **same direction each time** — like it’s **rolling over towards my right side**. I can’t say I’ve noticed it switching directions depending on the movement; it feels the same “way” whenever it’s triggered.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T66: 1.81 seconds):\n","One more detail to help me characterise it clearly: when you roll onto your **left** side (or lie on your back and turn your head **to the left**), do you ever get a similar brief room‑spinning episode—yes or no?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T66: 2.08 seconds):\n","If I roll onto my **left** side or turn my head **to the left** while I’m on my back, **no**, I don’t get the same brief room‑spinning.\n","\n","At most it might feel a tiny bit “off” for a moment, but it doesn’t trigger that proper spinning the way the **right** side does.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T67: 1.27 seconds):\n","Is there anything else you think I should know about your injury or how you’ve been feeling? Do you have any questions for me right now?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T67: 5.83 seconds):\n","I think you’ve covered most of it, to be honest.\n","\n","The key things from my side are:\n","\n","- It’s **very positional and brief** — I’m not constantly dizzy. It’s the **10–20 seconds of room-spinning** with a **couple-second delay** after I **roll/turn to the right**, **look up**, or **bend**, and then it stops if I keep still.  \n","- It’s **consistently the right side** — turning/rolling to the left doesn’t really set it off in the same way.  \n","- I get **nausea** with it but **no vomiting**, and I’ve had **no hearing changes** or ringing, and no other worrying neuro symptoms.  \n","- The main impact is **sleep disruption** and **feeling less safe at work**, especially with moving/handling and on night shifts.\n","\n","Questions-wise, I don’t have anything new beyond what I asked earlier — I’m mainly just hoping there’s a clear next step and something practical that can be done to stop it, because it’s starting to feel like it’s not shifting on its own.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T68: 1.17 seconds):\n","Thank you.

They asked a few questions over the phone, checked I didn’t have any red flags like ongoing vomiting, weakness, speech problems, or a worsening headache, and advised rest and to come in if anything got worse. They mentioned it *could* be something like “positional vertigo” after a knock, but I haven’t had any scans or anything like that.\n","\n","I haven’t been to A&E. I’ve just been trying to manage it myself and be careful at work, but it’s starting to feel like I need something more specific because it keeps happening.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T14: 6.02 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any **severe or worsening headache** (different from that mild one on the day), either constant or coming in bursts?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T14: 2.34 seconds):\n","No, not really.

No weakness, numbness, or tingling in my face or in my arms or legs—either during the dizzy spells or in between them.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T20: 5.47 seconds):\n","Have you noticed any **slurred speech, trouble finding words, facial droop, or new confusion/drowsiness** at any point since the fall (either during an episode or in between)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T20: 2.02 seconds):\n","No, none of that. My speech has been normal, I haven’t had any trouble finding words, no facial droop, and I haven’t felt confused or unusually drowsy.

If I move slowly and keep my head steady, I’m generally okay.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T24: 4.16 seconds):\n","Can you tell me more about the **right-sided neck soreness**—specifically, where you feel it (back of neck vs side), and whether it’s constant or only with certain movements?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T24: 3.04 seconds):\n","It’s mostly on the **right side of my neck**, kind of where the neck meets the shoulder—more **along the side/back** rather than right in the middle of my spine.\n","\n","It’s **not constant**. Most of the time it’s just a mild ache that I’m aware of, but it’s definitely **worse with certain movements**, like if I turn my head to the right, look up, or if I’ve had a busy shift and I’ve been moving patients. I’d rate it about a **3 out of 10**—annoying more than anything, not sharp or severe.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T25: 5.59 seconds):\n","At the time of the fall, had you had **any alcohol or other substances** (including recreational drugs or sedating medications) that day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T25: 1.57 seconds):\n","No. I hadn’t had any alcohol or taken anything like that. No recreational drugs, and no sedating medications. Just my usual salbutamol inhaler if needed, and I hadn’t even used that around the time of the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T26: 5.79 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any other changes like **brain fog/slowed thinking**, **trouble concentrating**, or **memory difficulties** compared with your usual baseline?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T26: 2.91 seconds):\n","No, not really. Mentally I feel like myself — no brain fog or slowed thinking, and I haven’t noticed any new problems with memory.\n","\n","The only time I feel a bit “off” is right around the spinning episodes because it’s so disorientating, but once it settles my concentration and thinking are normal. I’ve been able to work and do my usual paperwork without any issues.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T27: 5.40 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any changes in your **sleep or fatigue**—for example trouble falling or staying asleep, sleeping more than usual, or feeling unusually tired during the day?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T27: 3.49 seconds):\n","Yeah, a bit — mainly because of the dizziness rather than feeling “post-head-injury” tired.\n","\n","I’m finding it harder to stay asleep because if I roll over in the night, especially onto my right side, it can set the spinning off and it wakes me up. So I’m a bit more broken-sleep than usual. I’m not sleeping loads more than normal, but I do feel more tired on the days after a bad night, and night shifts have felt harder because I’m already a bit on edge about triggering it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T28: 10.91 seconds):\n","Before this fall, have you ever had a **previous head injury or concussion**, even a mild one (including sports injuries or childhood knocks)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T28: 1.94 seconds):\n","No, nothing significant.

I don’t get recurrent ear infections either.\n","\n","And I don’t have migraines.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T30: 5.66 seconds):\n","When you spoke with your GP, did they ever examine you in person—especially checking your eye movements or doing any positional tests (for example moving you quickly from sitting to lying with your head turned)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T30: 2.46 seconds):\n","No, they didn’t examine me in person. It was just a phone call—so they didn’t check my eye movements or do any of those positional tests where they move you back quickly with your head turned. They mostly asked about symptoms and warning signs and then suggested it might be positional vertigo and to keep an eye on it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T31: 5.02 seconds):\n","Do you have any significant past medical conditions (for example asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems), and are you currently pregnant or recently postpartum?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T31: 1.43 seconds):\n","I’ve got **mild asthma**, but nothing else major—no high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems.\n","\n","And no, I’m **not pregnant** and I’m not postpartum.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T32: 5.06 seconds):\n","What medications do you take regularly or as needed (including any blood thinners like warfarin/apixaban/rivaroxaban/aspirin), and do you have any medication allergies?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T32: 2.05 seconds):\n","I don’t take anything regularly apart from my **salbutamol inhaler** for mild asthma, as needed.\n","\n","Since the fall I’ve taken **paracetamol** occasionally for the headache/neck soreness.\n","\n","I’m **not on any blood thinners** or aspirin.\n","\n","I have **no known drug allergies**.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T33: 5.83 seconds):\n","How has the dizziness affected your day-to-day functioning—particularly your work as a nurse (for example needing time off, modified duties, avoiding certain tasks, or feeling unsafe with any parts of the job)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T33: 6.70 seconds):\n","It’s definitely affected me, mainly because it’s so unpredictable and it’s triggered by normal movements.\n","\n","At work on the acute medical unit I’ve still been going in, but I’m being a lot more cautious. I feel **unsafe with things like moving and handling**—especially if I have to **bend**, **look up** for equipment, or **turn quickly** around a bed space. I’m really conscious that if I get that sudden spin while I’m supporting a patient or using a hoist, I could put them or myself at risk.\n","\n","I haven’t taken proper time off yet, but I’ve tried to **avoid the heavier turns** when I can and I’ve been asking colleagues for help more than I normally would. **Night shifts are harder** because I’m already tired and then if I roll over in bed and set it off, I’m not sleeping well beforehand. I’m still functioning, but I don’t feel as confident or steady as usual, and it’s making me anxious at work.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T34: 5.13 seconds):\n","Are you currently **driving**, and if so, have you had any spinning episodes while driving or felt unsafe on the road since the fall?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T34: 3.08 seconds):\n","I am still driving, yes, but I’ve been a lot more cautious.\n","\n","I haven’t had a full spinning episode *while* I’m actually driving, because it tends to happen with rolling over, looking up, or bending. But I do sometimes feel a bit “off” if I’ve moved my head quickly, so I’m avoiding things like checking a high mirror angle too fast, and I won’t drive if I’ve had a rough patch of episodes or I’m feeling particularly unsteady.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T35: 4.78 seconds):\n","Since the fall and these vertigo episodes starting, have you noticed any changes in your **mood or anxiety**—for example feeling more anxious (including panic), low in mood, irritable, or avoiding certain situations because you’re worried about triggering the spinning?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T35: 5.90 seconds):\n","Yeah, I’d say I’m definitely **more anxious** than I normally am. Part of it is the feeling itself—it’s so intense and sudden that it makes me a bit panicky in the moment, even though it only lasts seconds.\n","\n","I’ve also been **worrying it could be something serious** going on in my head because it started after I hit it, and because it’s not really improving.\n","\n","And I am **avoiding certain things**. I’m trying not to roll onto my right side in bed, I’m moving more slowly, and I’ll avoid looking up or bending down quickly if I can. At work I’m more on edge about doing tasks where I might suddenly get that spin while I’m helping a patient. It’s not like I’m depressed, but it’s definitely stressing me out.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T36: 7.37 seconds):\n","How would you describe your **usual alcohol use** (for example, none, occasional/social, weekly amount), separate from the day of the fall?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T36: 1.32 seconds):\n","I’m a **rare/occasional** drinker really — maybe a glass of wine socially now and then, not every week. I don’t drink heavily.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T37: 4.97 seconds):\n","Do you smoke or use any nicotine products (including vaping), and if so how much?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T37: 1.05 seconds):\n","No, I don’t smoke and I don’t vape or use any nicotine products.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T38: 13.24 seconds):\n","Have you had any **seizure-like episodes** since the fall—such as sudden loss of awareness, uncontrollable shaking/jerking, or a blank spell that you couldn’t account for afterwards?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T38: 1.52 seconds):\n","No, nothing like that. I haven’t had any seizure-like episodes, no loss of awareness, no shaking or jerking, and no blank spells or periods I can’t account for since the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T39: 10.39 seconds):\n","Around the time the spinning started (a couple of days after the fall), did you have any **recent cold/viral illness**, **ear pain**, **ear discharge**, or a feeling of **blocked ears**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T39: 1.66 seconds):\n","No, I didn’t have a cold or any viral thing around then.\n","\n","No ear pain, no discharge, and my ears haven’t felt blocked or full at all. It really just seemed to start a couple of days after the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T40: 13.38 seconds):\n","When the spinning happens, has anyone noticed your **eyes jerking or flicking** (or have you seen it yourself in a mirror), even briefly?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T40: 2.90 seconds):\n","I haven’t had anyone point it out, and I haven’t actually seen my eyes doing it in a mirror.\n","\n","When it happens I usually just shut my eyes or grab onto something until it passes, so I’m not really looking at myself. It wouldn’t surprise me if my eyes were flicking because it feels like everything’s moving, but I can’t say for sure.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T41: 11.17 seconds):\n","On a 0–10 scale, where 0 is no symptoms and 10 is the worst you can imagine, how intense is the **spinning** at its worst during an episode?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T41: 2.03 seconds):\n","At its worst, I’d say it’s about an **8 out of 10**. It’s really intense for those few seconds—like the whole room is properly spinning—and then it drops off quickly once I keep still.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T42: 12.00 seconds):\n","Have these dizziness spells caused any **falls or near-falls at home**, or made you feel unsafe doing things like **showering, using stairs, or lifting/handling your child/pets (if relevant)**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T42: 4.48 seconds):\n","I haven’t actually **fallen**, but I’ve had a few **near-misses**.\n","\n","At home it’s mostly in the **night**—if I roll over and it hits, I’ll grab the bed or the wall because it feels like I could topple. On the **stairs** I’m extra careful and I tend to hold the handrail now, especially if I’ve just had an episode or I’m feeling a bit off-balance.\n","\n","**Showering** feels a bit risky if I have to tilt my head back to rinse my hair, so I’ve been doing it more slowly and keeping my head more upright. I don’t have kids, and we don’t have any pets to lift, but I do worry about carrying things and bending down because that can trigger it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T43: 11.09 seconds):\n","During these episodes, does it feel like **true spinning/rotation** (as you’ve described), or do you ever also get **lightheaded like you might faint** (for example greying/blackening of vision, needing to sit down to avoid passing out)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T43: 2.55 seconds):\n","It feels like **true spinning/rotation**, like the whole room is moving around me.\n","\n","I don’t really get that **faint/lightheaded** feeling — no greying or blacking out of my vision, and I don’t feel like I’m going to pass out. I do usually want to **hold on or sit still** when it happens, but that’s because of the spinning and nausea rather than feeling faint.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T44: 13.62 seconds):\n","Just to make sure I have the timeline right, Aisha: was the fall on **Wednesday 17th December 2025**, around 4pm?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T44: 3.41 seconds):\n","Yes, that’s right — **Wednesday 17th December 2025**, late afternoon, around **4pm**.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T45: 8.47 seconds):\n","Have you tried any treatments so far for the dizziness—such as any medications (for nausea/vertigo) or any exercises/movements aimed at it—and if so, did anything help or make it worse?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T45: 5.24 seconds):\n","I haven’t really had any proper treatment yet.\n","\n","I’ve taken **paracetamol** now and then for the neck soreness, but nothing specific for the dizziness. I haven’t used any anti-sickness tablets or “vertigo meds.”\n","\n","In terms of self-help, I’ve basically just been **avoiding the movements** that set it off—rolling onto my right side, looking up, bending—and trying to **move more slowly**. That helps a bit in the sense that I can sometimes *reduce* how often I trigger it, but it doesn’t stop it if I do the wrong movement. If anything, when I’ve accidentally moved quickly, it definitely makes it worse in that moment.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T46: 10.93 seconds):\n","When the spinning comes on, do you get **any headache at the same time** (or right afterwards), and if so where is it and how severe (0–10)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T46: 3.18 seconds):\n","Not usually, no. When the spinning happens it’s mainly just the vertigo and the nausea.\n","\n","Occasionally right afterwards I’ll get a very mild, dull head feeling—more like a little pressure than a proper headache—but it’s not every time. If I had to rate that, it’d be maybe **1–2 out of 10**, and it doesn’t stick around. It’s not in a specific spot like a one-sided headache either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T47: 10.42 seconds):\n","Over the past three weeks since the fall, have you been feeling **persistently low in mood** or **less interest/pleasure** in things you’d normally enjoy?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T47: 2.52 seconds):\n","No, I wouldn’t say persistently low. I’m still interested in my usual things and I can enjoy them when I’m not having an episode.\n","\n","It’s more that I’ve been **stressed and a bit on edge**, and I’m avoiding certain movements or activities because I’m worried about triggering the spinning. So it’s affecting me, but it doesn’t feel like depression.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T48: 4.18 seconds):\n","Before the fall, did you have any history of **anxiety, depression, PTSD, or panic attacks**, or were you generally mentally well?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T48: 2.83 seconds):\n","I’ve generally been mentally well. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, no PTSD, and I haven’t had panic attacks before.\n","\n","Like anyone, I’ve had stressful periods with work, especially on the unit, but nothing I’ve needed treatment or medication for. The anxiety I’m feeling now feels very tied to the dizziness and worrying what it means.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T49: 9.41 seconds):\n","Have you ever had any **surgeries** in the past (including anything involving your **head/neck/ears**)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T49: 1.00 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Nothing involving my head, neck, or ears either.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T50: 5.05 seconds):\n","Do you have any **family history** of neurological problems (like stroke, seizures, balance disorders/vertigo) or significant **migraine** in close relatives?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T50: 4.08 seconds):\n","Not that I’m aware of, no.\n","\n","There’s no family history of seizures or balance/vertigo disorders that I know about, and migraines don’t really run in my family. My dad did have high blood pressure and he had a small stroke in his 60s, but nothing like what I’m having, and no one’s had anything major neurological when they were younger.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T51: 4.05 seconds):\n","Who do you live with at home, and do you have someone who can help you if you have a bad dizziness spell (especially at night)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T51: 1.97 seconds):\n","I live with my partner. She’s been really helpful — if I have a bad spell at night and I wake up spinning, she’ll sit up with me, bring me some water, and just make sure I’m steady before I get up to use the bathroom. So yes, I do have someone at home who can help if it hits.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T52: 5.97 seconds):\n","Do you need any help with **basic day-to-day activities** since this started—like washing/showering, dressing, cooking, or getting around the house—or are you managing those independently?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T52: 4.29 seconds):\n","I’m mostly managing those things independently, yeah.\n","\n","It’s more that I’m doing everything a bit more cautiously. Showering can feel a bit dodgy if I tilt my head back, so I take my time and keep my head more upright. Cooking and getting around the house is fine as long as I don’t bend down or look up quickly. If I’m having a “bad day” with more spins, I might ask my partner to grab things from high shelves or pick things up off the floor, but I’m not needing regular help with dressing or basic stuff.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T53: 5.42 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any **marked increase in thirst** or needing to **urinate much more often than usual** (including waking multiple times at night to pass urine)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T53: 2.75 seconds):\n","No, not really. I haven’t noticed being unusually thirsty, and I’m not needing to pass urine more than normal.\n","\n","If I’m up in the night, it’s usually because I’ve rolled over and triggered the spinning, not because I’m waking to pee.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T54: 8.70 seconds):\n","Outside of the day of the fall, do you use any **recreational drugs** at all (including cannabis, stimulants, or anything else)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T54: 1.21 seconds):\n","No, I don’t use any recreational drugs at all — no cannabis, stimulants, or anything else.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T55: 23.35 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any signs of head/face injury like **bruising around the eyes**, **bruising behind the ear**, or any **clear fluid/blood coming from your nose or ears**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T55: 2.28 seconds):\n","No, none of that. I didn’t get any bruising around my eyes or behind my ear, and there’s been **no fluid or blood** coming from my nose or ears. Just a bit of tenderness where I knocked the right side of my head, and that settled after a couple of days.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T56: 15.10 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you gone back to **cycling or other exercise**, and if so does **physical exertion** (getting your heart rate up) change the dizziness at all, or is it still mainly triggered by specific head movements/positions?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T56: 3.80 seconds):\n","I haven’t gone back to cycling yet — I’m honestly a bit nervous about it because I don’t want to get a spin spell while I’m on the bike and come off again.\n","\n","I have done a bit of light exercise, like walking, and that’s been fine. **Getting my heart rate up doesn’t seem to bring it on** in itself. It still feels **mainly triggered by specific head positions or movements**—rolling over, looking up, bending down—rather than exertion.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T57: 12.30 seconds):\n","When you trigger the spinning (for example rolling onto your right side), if you **repeat the same movement again soon after**, does it **reliably happen again each time**, or does it sometimes **ease off or “fatigue”** (less intense) if you try it repeatedly within a few minutes?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T57: 4.75 seconds):\n","If I do the exact same movement again soon after, it **can happen again**, but it often feels a bit **less intense the second or third time**, like it “wears out” slightly for a little while.\n","\n","That said, if I leave it and then do the movement again later—especially rolling onto my right side—it’ll **come back properly**. Moving slowly seems to help a bit too.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T58: 11.52 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any **sudden, severe neck pain** or a **new severe headache at the back of your head** (different from your usual), even if it was brief?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T58: 4.60 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had anything sudden or severe like that.\n","\n","My neck has just been **mildly sore on the right side** since the fall, more of an ache and stiffness, and it only really flares if I move it a certain way or after a busy shift. And I haven’t had a new, severe headache at the back of my head.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T59: 11.61 seconds):\n","Have you tried any specific **positional manoeuvres/exercises** for the dizziness (for example things you might find online like the **Epley** or **Semont** manoeuvre), and if so what happened when you tried them?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T59: 3.08 seconds):\n","I haven’t tried anything like the Epley or Semont properly, no.\n","\n","I did look online and watched a couple of videos, but I got a bit nervous about doing it to myself without someone checking it’s the right side/ear, and I was worried about making it worse or doing it wrong—especially with my neck being a bit sore. So I’ve basically just been avoiding the positions that trigger it rather than doing specific manoeuvres.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T60: 12.27 seconds):\n","Between the spinning episodes, when you’re sitting or standing still, how would you rate your **baseline dizziness/unsteadiness** on a **0–10** scale (0 = none, 10 = worst), and is it present most of the day or only at certain times?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T60: 2.70 seconds):\n","Between episodes, it’s pretty mild — I’d say around a **2 out of 10** most of the time.\n","\n","It’s not like I feel dizzy constantly. It’s more a slightly **off-balance / “not quite steady”** feeling that comes and goes through the day, and I notice it more if I’ve had a few spins close together, or if I’m tired (like after a night shift). If I’m just sitting still, I often feel basically normal.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T61: 18.77 seconds):\n","Before this fall, did you have any **neck problems or prior neck injuries** (for example whiplash, slipped disc, chronic neck pain), or was your neck generally fine?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T61: 1.64 seconds):\n","No, my neck was generally fine before this. I didn’t have any prior neck injuries or chronic neck pain—no whiplash, no slipped disc, nothing like that. The soreness really started after the fall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T62: 13.95 seconds):\n","During a spinning episode, do you notice any other body symptoms like **sweating**, **heart racing/palpitations**, **chest pain**, or **shortness of breath**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T62: 2.31 seconds):\n","During the spinning itself, I do sometimes get a bit **clammy** and my **heart feels like it’s racing**, but I think that’s partly because it’s so sudden and it makes me anxious in the moment.\n","\n","I **don’t get chest pain**, and I **don’t feel short of breath** during the episodes. My breathing feels normal.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T63: 4.27 seconds):\n","When you notice your heart racing during an episode, does it settle as soon as the spinning stops (within seconds), or does it continue for minutes afterwards?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T63: 2.51 seconds):\n","It pretty much **settles once the spinning stops**, or within a minute or so. The worst of the racing feeling is in that moment when everything’s spinning and I’m trying not to move. Once it passes and I’m steady again, my heart rate comes back down fairly quickly.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T64: 18.02 seconds):\n","Have you had **any episodes where the spinning lasted longer than about a minute**, or any times where the dizziness became **continuous for hours** rather than brief bursts?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T64: 3.32 seconds):\n","No — it’s always been **brief**. The spinning is usually **10–20 seconds**, maybe **half a minute at most**, and then it settles if I keep still.\n","\n","I haven’t had any episodes where it went on for **minutes and minutes**, and I definitely haven’t had **continuous dizziness for hours**. Between spells I just feel a bit off-balance sometimes, but not like the room is spinning nonstop.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T65: 11.84 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any change in your **sense of smell or taste** (for example things smelling weaker/odd, or food tasting different)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T65: 1.10 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t noticed any change in my smell or taste. Everything smells and tastes normal to me.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T66: 16.06 seconds):\n","When you **bend down** and it triggers the spinning, does it seem to be from **moving your head** (tilting it down/up), or would it still happen if you **squat/bend at the knees while keeping your head level and still**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T66: 3.80 seconds):\n","It feels much more like it’s the **head movement/position** that sets it off.\n","\n","If I **bend from the waist** and my head tips down and then I lift it back up, that can trigger it. If I’m really careful and **squat down** more with my knees and try to **keep my head level and move slowly**, it’s *less likely* to happen. I can’t say it never happens that way, but it definitely seems worse when my head is tipping or changing angle.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T67: 13.95 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you noticed any new **sensitivity to light or noise** (for example bright lights bothering you more than usual, or feeling overwhelmed by busy/noisy environments)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T67: 3.70 seconds):\n","No, not really. Bright lights and noise don’t seem to bother me any more than usual.\n","\n","If I’ve just had a spinning episode and I’m feeling queasy, I might prefer things a bit calmer for a few minutes, but I wouldn’t say I’ve developed a new sensitivity to light or sound overall.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T68: 7.18 seconds):\n","Has your GP arranged any follow-up yet—such as an in-person assessment, referral to ENT/neurology, or vestibular physiotherapy—and if so, what’s the plan and timing?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T68: 3.40 seconds):\n","No, not yet. When I spoke to them it was more of a “keep an eye on it” and come back if it got worse or if I developed any warning signs.\n","\n","I haven’t had an in-person appointment arranged, and there’s been no referral to ENT or neurology or vestibular physio so far. I was kind of hoping to get seen properly because it’s been three weeks now and it’s still happening.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T69: 11.60 seconds):\n","When you’re **upright** (sitting or standing), if you **turn your head to the right** (without lying down) does that ever trigger the same **brief room-spinning**, or is it only with **lying/rolling, looking up, or bending**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T69: 2.61 seconds):\n","If I’m upright and I just turn my head to the right, it *usually doesn’t* trigger the full room-spinning in the same way.\n","\n","It’s much more **lying down/rolling in bed**, **looking up**, or **bending down** that brings on the proper spinning. Turning my head to the right when I’m standing might make me feel a bit “off” or cautious, but it doesn’t reliably set off that intense 10–20 second spin like rolling onto my right side does.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T70: 7.61 seconds):\n","When you checked your helmet after the fall, did you notice any **visible damage** (cracks/dents), and did it feel like it **stayed securely in place** during the impact?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T70: 3.38 seconds):\n","After the fall I took the helmet off and had a look. I didn’t see any **cracks**, but there was a **scuff/scrape mark** on the right side where it must’ve hit the ground. It didn’t look obviously dented, but it definitely had taken a knock.\n","\n","It felt like it **stayed on properly**—the straps were done up and it didn’t fly off or twist right round. I remember it feeling secure when I got up.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T71: 16.88 seconds):\n","Since the fall, have you had any **neck treatment or manipulation**—for example **chiropractic adjustment**, osteopathy, deep tissue massage, or self-manipulation/cracking your neck—either before or after the dizziness started?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T71: 3.16 seconds):\n","No, I haven’t had any neck treatment or manipulation.\n","\n","I haven’t seen a chiropractor or osteopath, and I haven’t had any deep tissue massage. I also haven’t been cracking my neck or anything like that—just gentle stretching now and then, and trying not to aggravate it.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T72: 10.97 seconds):\n","Does the right-sided neck soreness ever **radiate** into your shoulder/arm (or cause **tingling/numbness** in the arm or hand), or is it just localized neck ache/stiffness?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T72: 2.84 seconds):\n","No, it doesn’t radiate down into my shoulder or arm, and I haven’t had any tingling or numbness in my arm or hand.\n","\n","It’s really just a **localized ache/stiffness** on the right side of my neck, kind of where the neck meets the shoulder, and it’s mainly noticeable with certain movements or after a busy shift.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T73: 10.53 seconds):\n","Have you discussed this with your workplace (for example your manager or occupational health), and have any **temporary adjustments** been put in place (like avoiding moving/handling, limiting tasks that involve bending/looking up, or changing shifts)?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T73: 4.45 seconds):\n","I’ve mentioned it to my nurse-in-charge on shift a couple of times, more informally, because I didn’t want to make a big thing of it without knowing what it is. They’ve been understanding in the moment and I’ve been able to swap out of some of the heavier moving-and-handling when I’m feeling wobbly, or ask someone to double up with me.\n","\n","But I **haven’t officially gone to occupational health** yet, and there isn’t a formal adjustment plan in place. I’m kind of at the point where I think I probably should, because it’s not going away and I don’t want to put a patient at risk if I get a sudden spin while I’m helping them.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T74: 26.95 seconds):\n","Outside of work, how has this been affecting your **social life, hobbies, or exercise**—are you avoiding any activities or have you stopped doing anything you’d normally do?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T74: 6.45 seconds):\n","Yeah, it’s definitely had an impact.\n","\n","I’ve **stopped cycling** completely for now because I’m worried I’ll get a spinning spell if I have to look up or check over my shoulder and then I could come off the bike again. I’m still **walking**, but I’m more cautious—especially on uneven ground, and I avoid anything that involves a lot of bending or looking up.\n","\n","Socially, I’m still seeing people, but I’m a bit more **reserved** about going out if I’m feeling particularly “off,” and I’ll avoid busy places where I might have to move my head around a lot. Even little things at home—like reaching up to high cupboards or cleaning—I've been either doing really slowly or asking my partner to help.\n","\n","It’s not like I’m housebound, but it’s made me more cautious and it’s taken some of the spontaneity out of my normal routine.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T75: 16.62 seconds):\n","Aisha, to pin down the timeline a bit more: **when did you have the very first spinning episode** after the fall—what date (or how many days later), and **what were you doing when it first happened**?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T75: 4.69 seconds):\n","It was **about 2–3 days after the fall**, so around **Friday the 19th or Saturday the 20th of December**.\n","\n","The very first time it happened I was **in bed**, rolling over — I’m pretty sure I was turning **onto my right side**. I remember it because it was so sudden: there was a brief second or two and then the room just **spun hard** for maybe **10–20 seconds**, and I felt really nauseous. Once I stayed still it settled, but it really freaked me out because I’d never had anything like it before.\n","\n","\n","AI TBI Assistant (T76: 10.14 seconds):\n","Is there anything else you think I should know about your injury or how you’ve been feeling? Do you have any questions for me right now?\n","\n","\n","Patient (T76: 5.45 seconds):\n","I think the main thing is just how **positional and brief** it is — it really feels like it has a clear trigger (rolling onto my **right** in bed, **looking up**, **bending**) and then it’s that intense **room-spinning** for a few seconds and it stops if I keep still. In between I’m mostly okay, just a bit “off” balance-wise.\n","\n","What’s been bothering me is that it started after I **hit my head**, and it’s been **three weeks** without really improving, so I keep worrying: is this something **serious in my brain** that’s been missed?

Fell onto right side; shoulder/arm contacted first, then helmeted head struck ground at **right parietal** region. Helmet remained secured; visible scuff only, no crack.\n","\n","- **Immediate symptoms (same day):**\n","  - **No loss of consciousness**\n","  - **No confusion/dazed feeling**\n","  - **No amnesia**\n","  - Mild headache later that day only; local scalp tenderness 1–2 days.\n","  - Mild right-sided neck stiffness/soreness began after fall.\n","\n","- **Delayed symptom onset (19–20 Dec 2025; ~2–3 days post-injury):**\n","  - First episode occurred in bed when rolling **onto right side**: brief delay of seconds → intense **room-spinning vertigo** lasting **10–20 seconds** with nausea.\n","\n","- **Course over ~3 weeks (to current):**\n","  - Vertigo remains **positional**, brief, and **reproducible**:\n","    - Worst triggers: rolling in bed to the **right**, **looking up**, **bending down**.\n","    - Frequency: **6–8 episodes/day**, relatively unchanged; may “fatigue” with repetition.\n","  - Baseline between spells: mild disequilibrium (**~2/10**), intermittent.\n","  - Associated symptoms: nausea (no vomiting), momentary clamminess/palpitations during episodes.\n","  - No auditory symptoms (no hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness).\n","  - No focal neuro symptoms (no weakness/numbness, dysarthria, diplopia, confusion, seizures).\n","  - Sleep disruption due to positional triggers during the night.\n","  - Functional impact: safety concerns at work (moving/handling, bending, turning quickly); stopped cycling; cautious driving.\n","\n","- **Healthcare received:**\n","  - GP telephone call ~1 week post-fall: screened for red flags; advised rest; mentioned possible “positional vertigo.”  \n","  - **No in-person exam**, **no positional testing**, **no imaging**, **no vestibular therapy** to date.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### History Summary\n","\n","Aisha is a **35-year-old female nurse** who sustained a **minor helmeted right parietal head impact** during a low-speed cycling fall (17 Dec 2025). She reports **no LOC**, **no post-traumatic amnesia**, and no immediate neurologic symptoms other than a **mild headache** on the day of injury.\n","\n","Approximately **2–3 days later**, she developed **brief (10–20 s), intense (8/10) episodes of true rotational vertigo** with a short latency after movement, most reliably triggered by **rolling onto the right in bed**, **neck extension/looking up**, and **bending**. Between episodes she feels mildly off-balance. Symptoms have persisted for **~3 weeks** without clear improvement. She denies hearing changes, persistent headache, vomiting, visual loss/diplopia, focal weakness/numbness, speech change, confusion, excessive drowsiness, seizures, or CSF leak symptoms.\n","\n","Neck symptoms: mild right posterolateral neck ache/stiffness (approx. 3/10), worse with turning right/looking up and after busy shifts; no radicular features.\n","\n","Functional impact: ongoing work attendance but avoiding heavy moving/handling; anxiety related to unpredictability and patient safety; stopped cycling; cautious driving.\n","\n","Relevant PMH: mild asthma (salbutamol PRN). No anticoagulants/antiplatelets. No surgeries. No migraine history. No prior concussion/head injury. No substance use around injury.\n","\n","**Verbatim patient phrasing (salient):**\n","- “I’m getting these spins when I roll over or look up—since I bumped my head.”  \n","- “It lasts maybe 10–20 seconds…then settles if I keep still.”  \n","- “I feel unsafe with things like moving and handling…if I get that sudden spin while I’m supporting a patient…”\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### The Mayo Classification System for Traumatic Brain Injury Severity\n","\n","**Classification: Symptomatic (Possible) TBI**\n","\n","- **Criteria A (Moderate-Severe/Definite):** Not met (no LOC ≥30 min; no PTA ≥24 h; no GCS <13; no intracranial lesion reported; no penetrating injury).\n","- **Criteria B (Mild/Probable):** Not met (no LOC; no PTA; no skull fracture reported).\n","- **Criteria C (Symptomatic/Possible):** Met due to **dizziness/vertigo** and **headache** temporally associated with head impact.\n","\n","*Clinical caveat:* The current syndrome is most consistent with a **peripheral vestibular disorder (post-traumatic BPPV)** rather than a primary diffuse brain injury, but Mayo criteria classify based on symptoms and available injury markers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### Differential Diagnosis (Ranked)\n","\n","### 1) **Post-traumatic Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), likely right posterior canal** — *Most likely*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Classic positional triggers: rolling in bed (especially **to the right**), looking up (extension), bending.\n","  - **Brief** discrete vertigo bursts (**10–20 s**) with **latency of a few seconds**, and **fatigability** with repetition.\n","  - Nausea during spells; mild imbalance between spells.\n","  - No hearing loss/tinnitus/aural fullness (argues against Ménière’s).\n","  - Clear temporal relationship to head trauma; post-traumatic BPPV is well-described.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - None strong; persistent daily frequency for 3 weeks is still compatible (often persists without canalith repositioning).\n","  - Eye movements (nystagmus) not yet observed—needs positional testing.\n","- **Quality of evidence (TBI context)**\n","  - **High** for canalith repositioning efficacy in BPPV generally (multiple RCTs; Cochrane review: **Hilton & Pinder, 2014**).  \n","  - **Moderate** evidence that head trauma increases BPPV risk and recurrence; clinical consensus supports post-traumatic BPPV as common after minor head/whiplash mechanisms.\n","\n","### 2) **Cervicogenic dizziness / neck-related proprioceptive dysfunction (post-fall cervical strain)** — *Possible contributor*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Persistent right-sided neck soreness since the fall; worse with neck movements.\n","  - Mild baseline disequilibrium between vertigo spells.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - The hallmark **brief, positional, true spinning** episodes with latency/fatigue are more typical of BPPV than cervicogenic dizziness (which is usually more non-rotational disequilibrium and less paroxysmal).\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Low–moderate**; diagnosis remains clinical and controversial; best considered a comorbidity after excluding vestibular and central causes.\n","\n","### 3) **Central positional vertigo (e.g., cerebellar/brainstem pathology)** — *Less likely but important to exclude if atypical course*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Persistent symptoms post-head impact; occupational safety risk.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - No focal neurological deficits, no persistent spontaneous vertigo, no diplopia/dysarthria, no severe headache, no progressive course.\n","  - Spells are very brief, triggered, with latency and fatigability—more peripheral pattern.\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Low** based on history alone; requires exam (HINTS when symptomatic, neuro exam) and consideration of imaging only if atypical features or non-response.\n","\n","### 4) **Vestibular migraine (including trauma-triggered)** — *Unlikely*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Episodic vestibular symptoms with nausea.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - No migraine history; spells are seconds-long and tightly positional (vestibular migraine episodes typically minutes–hours and not so strictly fatigable/positional).\n","  - No photophobia/phonophobia or migrainous headache pattern.\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Low** for this presentation.\n","\n","### 5) **Intracranial injury (delayed hemorrhage/contusion)** — *Unlikely given current data*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Head impact history.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - No anticoagulants, no LOC/amnesia, no worsening headache, no vomiting, no focal deficits, no deterioration over 3 weeks.\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Low** likelihood clinically; imaging indications should follow guideline triggers and evolving symptoms.\n","\n","### 6) **Vertebral artery dissection / vascular cause of vertigo** — *Very unlikely but safety-critical*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - Neck pain after fall.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - Neck pain is mild (3/10), no sudden severe occipital headache, no persistent continuous vertigo, no neuro deficits. No neck manipulation.\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Very low** from current history; consider only if red flags develop.\n","\n","### 7) **Anxiety/adjustment response secondary to vertigo** — *Likely comorbidity*\n","- **Supporting features**\n","  - New anxiety tied to unpredictability and fear of serious cause; situational avoidance.\n","- **Features against**\n","  - Symptoms are strongly positional with classic vestibular pattern; anxiety appears reactive rather than primary.\n","- **Quality of evidence**\n","  - **Moderate** as a common secondary consequence of vertigo/concussion syndromes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### Suggested Management (for treating clinician)\n","\n","### Immediate actions (priority)\n","1. **In-person assessment with positional testing**\n","   - **Dix–Hallpike** (right/left) to identify posterior canal BPPV and elicit characteristic nystagmus/symptoms.\n","   - **Supine roll test** if horizontal canal BPPV suspected.\n","   - Full neuro exam; consider **HINTS** only if patient has *continuous acute vestibular syndrome* (not currently described).\n","\n","2. **Safety / occupational risk mitigation**\n","   - Given frequent spells and patient-facing manual handling risk, recommend **temporary work restrictions** (avoid solo moving/handling, avoid ladders/step stools, limit tasks requiring rapid head turns/extension) and **Occupational Health** review.\n","   - Driving: advise avoiding driving if feeling “off,” sleep-deprived, or if head movements during driving could provoke symptoms; consider temporary avoidance until better controlled (local rules vary; document advice).\n","\n","### Investigations\n","**Imaging (guided by NICE NG232 and clinical features)**\n","- **CT head (urgent)** is **not indicated on current history** under typical NICE NG232 acute CT triggers (no LOC, no amnesia, no vomiting, no seizure, no focal deficit, no anticoagulants, no dangerous mechanism at high speed, no skull fracture signs).  \n","- **MRI brain ± internal auditory canals**: consider **only if**:\n","  - Positional tests are negative/atypical, or\n","  - No meaningful response to appropriate canalith repositioning/vestibular therapy, or\n","  - New central features emerge (persistent spontaneous vertigo, focal deficits, new severe headache, diplopia, dysarthria, progressive gait ataxia).\n","\n","**Vestibular assessment**\n","- Referral to **vestibular physiotherapy** or ENT/audiology for formal assessment and guided manoeuvres (also to reduce recurrence and address residual imbalance).\n","\n","**Cervical assessment**\n","- If neck pain persists: MSK/physio assessment (ROM, cervicogenic contribution, posture, work ergonomics). Avoid high-velocity neck manipulation given post-trauma context.\n","\n","### Treatment\n","1. **Canalith repositioning manoeuvre (first-line)**\n","   - If right posterior canal BPPV confirmed, perform **Epley manoeuvre** (or Semont) with appropriate precautions for neck symptoms.\n","   - Evidence: canalith repositioning is supported by RCTs and systematic review evidence (e.g., **Hilton & Pinder, Cochrane 2014**).  \n","   - Post-traumatic BPPV may require **repeat manoeuvres** and has higher recurrence; provide plan for re-treatment.\n","\n","2. **Vestibular rehabilitation**\n","   - If residual imbalance persists after BPPV treatment (or if mixed vestibular dysfunction suspected), start vestibular rehab (gaze stabilization, balance training, habituation as appropriate).  \n","   - Evidence base: **moderate** for dizziness after concussion/vestibular dysfunction; systematic reviews generally support vestibular rehab improving dizziness and function (certainty varies by population and study quality).\n","\n","3. **Symptom relief (short-term)**\n","   - For severe nausea only: short course vestibular antiemetic (e.g., prochlorperazine per local practice), but **avoid prolonged vestibular suppressants** as they can impede vestibular compensation (expert consensus; evidence moderate).\n","\n","4. **Anxiety / sleep**\n","   - Address reassurance and education; consider brief CBT-based strategies if avoidance/anxiety persists once vertigo is treated.\n","   - Sleep protection plan (see patient advice section).\n","\n","### Follow-up\n","- **Review within 1–2 weeks** after first in-person manoeuvre/physio initiation:\n","  - Frequency/severity of episodes\n","  - Ability to roll right/extend neck without vertigo\n","  - Falls/near-falls, work safety, driving tolerance\n","  - Sleep quality and anxiety\n","- **Expedite review / urgent evaluation** if any red flags develop (listed below) or if symptoms become continuous/progressive.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### Expected Natural History\n","\n","- If this is **post-traumatic BPPV**, spontaneous resolution can occur over weeks to months, but many cases persist without treatment.  \n","- With appropriate canalith repositioning, many patients experience **rapid improvement** (often within days), though **repeat treatments** are sometimes needed—particularly after trauma.  \n","- Residual mild imbalance can persist transiently and often improves with vestibular rehab and normal activity resumption.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### Self-Management Advice for Patient (to reinforce clinically)\n","\n","### Activity\n","- Maintain **gentle daily activity** (e.g., walking). Avoid prolonged bed rest.\n","- Use **pacing**: move deliberately, especially with rolling, bending, and looking up.\n","- Consider sleeping slightly **propped up** and rolling slowly; avoid sudden rightward rolls until treated.\n","\n","### Return to work\n","- Seek **Occupational Health** input. Temporary modifications: avoid solo moving/handling, avoid tasks requiring repeated neck extension/reaching overhead, ensure support for high-risk tasks.\n","\n","### Return to sport/cycling\n","- Avoid cycling until vertigo is **substantially controlled** and head turns/looking up can be performed safely without provoking spins.\n","\n","### Symptom management\n","- During an episode: **stop moving, sit/lie still**, fix gaze on a stable point when possible, and allow it to pass.\n","- Reduce fall risk: use handrails on stairs; consider shower chair/non-slip mat if needed.\n","\n","### Medications\n","- Continue simple analgesia for neck discomfort as needed (per GP guidance).  \n","- Avoid routine long-term “vertigo suppressants” unless specifically advised for short-term rescue.\n","\n","### Lifestyle\n","- Avoid alcohol intoxication while symptomatic (worsens balance and sleep).  \n","- Protect sleep: consistent schedule where possible; strategies to minimize rolling triggers.\n","\n","### When to seek help (Emergency / A&E)\n","Seek urgent assessment if any of the following occur:\n","- **Severe worsening headache**\n","- **Repeated vomiting**\n","- **Seizure or fit**\n","- **Weakness or numbness**\n","- **Increasing confusion or difficulty waking**\n","- **Vision changes**, especially **double vision**\n","- **Clear fluid from nose or ears**\n","- New severe neck pain or new severe occipital headache (particularly if abrupt)\n","\n","Contact GP / arrange earlier neurology or ENT review if:\n","- Vertigo becomes **continuous** (hours) rather than brief spells\n","- New hearing loss/tinnitus develops\n","- Increasing falls/near-falls or inability to work safely\n","- No improvement after properly performed repositioning manoeuvres/physio\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ### Clinical Observations (from consultation)\n","\n","- History was **clear, coherent, and detailed** with intact recall for event and symptom timeline.  \n","- No reported cognitive deficits (no memory, concentration, word-finding issues).  \n","- Affect notable for **situational anxiety** related to symptom unpredictability and safety at work; avoidance behaviors present (sleep positioning, activity restriction, stopped cycling).\n","\n","--- \n","\n","**Overall impression:** Presentation is most consistent with **post-traumatic BPPV (likely right-sided)** with secondary sleep disruption/anxiety and possible mild cervical strain contribution.
