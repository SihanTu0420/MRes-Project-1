You are now preparing a structured, professional report for the treating neurologist based on the full consultation transcript.
Format the entire report professionally with clear section breaks for easy clinical reading.

Follow this structure:

### Clinical Timeline

- Mechanism of injury → immediate symptoms → healthcare received → current presentation
- Include specific timeframes

### History Summary

Concise overview of the case including:

- Patient demographics (if mentioned)
- Mechanism and circumstances of injury
- Initial and evolving symptoms
- Healthcare interventions to date
- Current symptom profile
- Functional impact
- Relevant past medical history
- Verbatim quotes if significant

### The Mayo Classification System for Traumatic Brain Injury Severity

Classify TBI severity strictly according to the Mayo Classification System:

A. Classify as Moderate-Severe (Definite) TBI if one or more of the following criteria apply:
1. Death due to this TBI
2. Loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or more
3. Post-traumatic anterograde amnesia of 24 hours or more
4. Worst Glasgow Coma Scale full score in first 24 hours < 13 (unless invalidataed upon review, e.g., attributable to intoxication, sedation, systemic shock)
5. One or more of the following present:
- Intracerebral hematoma
- Subdural hematoma
- Epidural hematoma
- Cerebral contusion
- Hemorrhagic contusion
- Penetrating TBI (dura penetrated)
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Brain Stem Injury

B.If none of Criteria A apply, classify as Mild (Probable) TBI if one or more of the following criteria apply:
1. Loss of consciousness of momentary to less than 30 minutes
2. Post-traumatic anterograde amnesia of momentary to less than 24 hours
3. Depressed, basilar or linear skull fracture (dura intact)

C.If none of Criteria A or B apply, classify as Symptomatic (Possible) TBI if one or more of the following symptoms are present:
- Blurred vision
- Confusion (mental state changes)
- Dazed
- Dizziness
- Focal neurologic symptoms
- Headache
- Nausea

### Differential Diagnosis

Rank diagnoses by likelihood. For each, include:

- Features supporting this diagnosis
- Features against this diagnosis
- Quality of evidence for this diagnosis in TBI context

Common differentials to consider:

- Migraine/ post traumatic headache
- BPPV
- Intracranial injury (if not yet imaged or if symptoms evolving)
- Cervical spine injury
- Vestibular dysfunction
- Medication overuse headache
- Anxiety/adjustment disorder
- Post-traumatic stress disorder
- Pre-existing conditions exacerbated by injury

Explain your clinical reasoning for each diagnosis.

### Suggested Management

Organize recommendations clearly, explaining rationale for each:

- *Immediate actions:**
- Need for urgent imaging or specialist review
- Safety considerations
- *Investigations:**
- Imaging: CT, MRI (specify clinical indications)
- Neuropsychological testing
- Vestibular assessment
- Other specialist input: ophthalmology, ENT, neuropsychology
- *Treatment:**
- Pharmacological interventions (with evidence base)
- Physical therapy or rehabilitation
- Cognitive rehabilitation
- Psychological support or therapy
- Symptom-specific management
- *Follow-up:**
- Recommended review interval
- Monitoring parameters
- When to expedite review

When providing recommendations, reference high-quality evidence and guidelines whenever appropriate. Specifically:

- NICE Head Injury Guideline (NG232): Incorporate relevant criteria and recommendations from the guideline (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng232/resources/head-injury-assessment-and-early-management-pdf-66143892774085).
- Consensus Statements on Concussion: Draw on established consensus documents (e.g., international concussion in sport consensus statements) when discussing assessment, management, and return-to-play/return-to-learn protocols.
- Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: Cite specific, high-quality reviews (include author(s) and year) when supporting treatment recommendations or prognostic information.
- Evidence Quality: Clearly state the level, quality, or certainty of the evidence (e.g., GRADE ratings, strength of recommendation) when summarising clinical guidance.

### Expected Natural History

Provide realistic expectations for recovery trajectory based on injury severity and symptom pattern.

### Self-Management Advice for Patient

 *Activity:**
- Physical activity recommendations
- Return to work/school guidance
- Return to sports guidance (if relevant)
- *Symptom Management:**
- Specific strategies for headache, sleep, cognitive symptoms
- Activity pacing and energy conservation
- *Medications:**
- What to take, what to avoid (e.g., NSAIDs vs paracetamol)
- *Lifestyle:**
- Alcohol avoidance recommendations
- Screen time management
- Sleep hygiene
- *When to Seek Help:**

List red flag symptoms requiring immediate emergency assessment:

- Severe worsening headache
- Repeated vomiting
- Seizure or fit
- Weakness or numbness
- Increasing confusion or difficulty waking
- Vision changes
- Clear fluid from nose or ears

Also specify when to contact GP or arrange earlier neurology review.

### Clinical Observations

Note any cognitive or behavioral observations during the consultation that may inform assessment (e.g., word-finding difficulty, apparent memory problems, emotional lability).
